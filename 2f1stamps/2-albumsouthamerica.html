Juan Manuel Fangio raced in F1 from 1950 to 1958.  He won the drivers championship in 1951 (Alfa Romeo), 1954 (Maserati/Daimler Benz), 1955 (Daimler Benz), 1956 (Ferrari) and 1957 (Maserati).  His record of five titles stood for 46 years until it was beaten by Michael Schumacher.  Many consider Fangio to be the greatest driver of all time - he has the highest winning percentage (46%) compared to Michael Schumacher's (33%).  He is also the only Agentine driver to have won the Argentine Grand Prix.

Fangio, unlike later Formula One drivers, started his racing career at a mature age and was the oldest driver in many of his races.  During his career, drivers raced almost with no protective equipment.  Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he would have a better chance with a better car.  As was then common, several of his race results were shared with team mates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems.  His rivals included Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Stirling Moss.

Ayrton Senna commemoration.

On 1st May 1994, Ayrton Senna's Williams FW16 left the track at the Tamburello corner on the seventh lap of the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola and collided with an unprotected concrete barrier. The crash itself was seemingly innocuous because, despite the telemetry later revealing that he was travelling at 193mph when he left the track, the collision itself appeared to be glancing and nobody was prepared for outcome that followed.

Tens of thousands of Italian Formula 1 fans looked on, open mouthed and disbelieving as Professor Sid Watkins performed an emergency tracheotomy on the driver whom he later confessed was already beyond saving. Professor Watkins was later quoted as saying "He looked serene. I raised his eyelids and it was clear from his pupils that he had a massive brain injury. We lifted him from the cockpit and laid him on the ground. As we did, he sighed and, although I am totally agnostic, I felt his soul depart at that moment."

Despite numerous conspiracy theories about what actually happened that day, it is generally accepted that the impact of the collision had caused one of the suspension beams to come adrift, piercing Senna's helmet and causing inter-cranial trauma just above his right eye. The incident followed a period of six laps where the drivers had been under the control of the safety-car and it was clear from the on-board camera on Michael Schumacher's Benetton that Senna's car was suffering from a notable loss of traction as the race restarted.

Francisco Sacco Landi, better known as Chico Landi (July 14, 1907 - June 7, 1989) was a racing driver from Sao Paulo, Brazil.  He participated in 6 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on September 16, 1951.  He scored a total of 1.5 championship points, awarded for his 4th place finish in the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix (driving a Maserati), a drive he shared with Gerino Gerini.  Landi was the first Brazilian driver to drive a Ferrari in a Formula One race, albeit not for the works team, and he drove one to victory at the Bari Grand Prix in 1948.

Piquet moved to Williams in 1986 which saw him becoming the team-mate of one of his fiercest rivals, Nigel Mansell.  Both were regarded as highly strung characters with delicate temperaments.  Two top drivers in the same team was a recipe for fireworks - and sure enough Mansell and Piquet went head to head for the title. Though the two drove the best cars on the grid, their rivalry caused each to deprive the other of points, allowing Alain Prost to win one of the closest and most fiercely disputed championships ever in F1.

1952 500 F2 - an F2 specification car powered by an in line four cylinder engine which was mounted behind the front axle, improving weight distribution.  Alberto Ascari won 9 straight races in the 500, a world championship record which still stands today. The 500 won all but one race it was entered in, making it the second most statistically successful car in the history of the FIA world championship, after McLaren MP4/4 which failed to win only one of its 16 races.
1953 500 F2
1958 246 F1 - the 246 used a 2417cc Dino V6 engine with a 65degree angle between the cylinder banks.  This was the first use of a V6 engine in an F1 car, but otherwise the 246 was a conventional front engine design.  The Ferrari 246 was good enough to win a World Championship for Mike Hawthorn and a second place in the Constructors Championship for Ferrari.

Wolf

In 1976 businessman Walter Wolf bought 60% of Frank Williams Racing Cars while agreeing to keep Frank Williams as manager of the team.  Simultaneously he bought the assets of the Hesketh team that had recently withdrawn from F1.  The team was based in the Williams facility at Reading but used most of the cars and equipment once owned by Hesketh Racing.  The Hesketh 308C became known as the Wolf-Williams FW05 and soon afterwards Harvey Postlethwaite arrived as chief engineer.

Jacky Ickx and Frenchman Michel Leclere were hired to drive.  The team, however, was not very competitive and failed to qualify at a number of races during the year.  Leclere left after the French Grand Prix and was replaced by Arturo Merzario, while Ickx failed to perform and was dropped after the British Grand Prix, to be followed by a string of pay-drivers.

At the end of 1976, Wolf decided that the team needed restructuring.  He removed Frank Williams from the manager's job and replaced him with Peter Warr from Team Lotus.  Disillusioned, Williams soon left the team, taking Patrick Head and several others to set up Williams Grand Prix Engineering.  Postlethwaite's WR1 was a conventional Cosworth package but with Jody Scheckter hired from Tyrrell, the new-look team presented a strong package.  No-one, however, expected that the team would win its first race in Argentina.

It was in many respects a lucky win with Scheckter starting tenth with six of the cars ahead of him retiring.  During the 1977 season, Scheckter went on to win the Monaco Grand Prix and the Canadian Grand Prix and also six other podium finishes which enabled him to finish second to Niki Lauda in the World Championship and gave Wolf fourth place in the Constructors' Championship.

The team remained the same for the 1978 season. Postlethwaite produced the WR5, a new car for the ground-effects era.  This did not appear until the Belgian GP.  Scheckter finished fourth in Spain and second in Germany but the WR5 soon made way for the WR6 with which he ended the year with a third in the US Grand Prix and second in Canada.  He finished seventh in the World Championship.

In 1979, Scheckter was signed up by Ferrari and Wolf signed James Hunt to replace him.  Postlethwaite designed the WR7 which ran with Olympus sponsorship.  The car was not very successful and retired more than 7 times during the first half of the season.  The WR8 soon followed.  In mid-season Hunt decided to retire and Wolf quickly hired Keke Rosberg to replace him.  The appearance of the WR9 did little to change the team's fortunes and at the end of the year Wolf grew tired of his F1 adventure and sold the team to Emerson Fittipaldi, who merged its assets into Fittipaldi Automotive.

A single stamp featuring Michael Schumacher as Formula 1 world champion with Ferrari.

The 1997 championship was decided under controversial circumstances as championship leader Michael Schumacher collided with Jacques Villeneuve whilst trying to defend his race lead in the final round of the championship (the European Grand prix, Jerez Spain).  Schumacher came to a halt in the gravel trap and was deemed at fault, his punishment was disqualification from the championship (gifting the title to Villeneuve).
