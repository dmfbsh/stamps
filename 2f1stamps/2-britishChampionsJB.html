		  <h2>2000 : BMW Williams</h2>
		  <div class="f1text">Button secured his race seat in a shoot-out between himself and one other driver.  At the time he was Britain's youngest ever F1 driver.  Button's first season was impressive - eighth place with 12 points.</div>

		  <h2>2001 : Benetton Renault</h2>
		  <div class="f1text">Williams had intended to use Button only until they could exercise their option to buy Juan Pablo Montoya, so Button was forced to look for another drive.  This was a dismal season - the car was very uncompetitive and he was consistently outperformed by his teammate.</div>

		  <div class="f1text">The team was rebranded for the 2002 season and Button worked hard over the winter break to improve his performance, as a result Button's race pace was much better than before.  Hoewever, it was announced mid-season that was to be replaced by Fernando Alonso.</div>

		  <h2>2003 - 2005 : BAR Honda</h2>
		  <div class="f1text">Button moved to BAR and faced early hostility from his new teammate Jacques Villeneuve.  However, Button was reasonably successful with BAR - in 2004, Button came third in the drivers' championship behind the dominant Ferrari drivers and helped BAR to second place in the constructors' championship.</div>
		  <h2>2006 - 2008 : Honda Racing F1 Team</h2>
		  <div class="f1text">At the end of the 2005 season Honda bought out BAR.  The early part of the 2006 season proved difficult, but after a chaotic Hungarian Grand Prix, Button emerged as the winner - his first race win.  For the next two seasons the Honda was not competitive.</div>

		  <h2>2009 : Brawn GP</h2>
		  <div class="f1text">At the end of 2008, Honda quit F1; in early 2009, Ross Brawn completed the management buyout. Button had to take a large pay cut as part of the deal.  Button dominated the early part of the season, benefiting from a controversial diffuser design - but the other teams did eventually catch up.  However, it was enough for Button to secure the World Championship.</div>

		  <h2>2015 - 2017 : McLaren Honda</h2>
		  <div class="f1text">The switch to Honda engines proved to be a disaster for McLaren.  Button was able to score a few points, but these seasons were dismal.  In 2017, Button stepped down as a race driver, becoming instead an ambassador for the team.  However, for the 2017 Monace Grand Prix, he substituted for Fernando Alonso (who was competing in the the Indianapolis 500) - Button retired from the race following an accident, this was his last ever F1 race and his association with McLaren concluded at the end of 2017.</div>
