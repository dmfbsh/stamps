<i>Issue date: 2003</i><br/><br/>
A mini sheet of one value featuring Jacques Villeneuve.

Following two successful years in CART, Villeneuve moved into F1 in 1996 with the front running Williams team, alongside Damon Hill.  In his debut season, Villeneuve challenged Hill for the title, winning four races and taking the fight to the final round in Japan, where the Canadian retired and Hill won the title.  Villeneuve, however, did win the following year's title, this time challenging Michael Schumacher and once again taking it to the final round in Jerez.  In the race, the two collided, resulting in Schumacher's retirement and subsequent disqualification from the 1997 World Championship, with Villeneuve going on to take third place in the race, and the overall title.
 
The last year in which Villeneuve would win a championship level race and finish the season in the top three was 1997.  Renault had pulled out of F1 for 1998 and Villeneuve's Williams team had to fare with less competitive Mecachrome engines.  Villeneuve moved to the newly formed British American Racing team in 1999 and stayed there for the next four seasons but, following poor results he was replaced by former British Formula Three Champion Takuma Sato.  After a short run with Renault at the end of 2004, Villeneuve moved to the Sauber team for the 2005 season where he was outscored by his less experienced teammate Felipe Massa.  The Sauber team were bought out by BMW for the following season and Villeneuve struggled to score points, taking seven points from eleven rounds before suffering an injury in Germany.  The Canadian was replaced by Robert Kubica and soon BMW and Villeneuve parted company.

<i>Issue date: 2015</i><br/><br/>
A commemorative sheet featuring Ayrton Senna.  The sheet also depicts two of Senna's closest rivals Alain Prost and Gehard Berger.  One of the greatest rivalries in F1 was that of Senna and Prost, which started in 1988 when Senna joined Prost at McLaren and continued until 1993 when Prost signed a contract with Williams that had a clause forbidding Senna from becoming his teammate.

Despite the bitter rivalry between Senna and Prost, the two had the utmost respect for one another.  This was evidenced by the fact that Prost was a pallbearer at Senna's funeral.  Years later Prost would say a part of him died when Senna perished because their rivalry had been so great.
