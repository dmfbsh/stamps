A set of 8 stamps showing various Ferrari F1 cars.

1957 - 801 - derived from the Ferrari D50 (in which Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1956 drivers championship), the 801 was largely uncompetitive against the latest generation of Maserati 250Fs
1959 - 256 (should be 246?) F1 - successor to the 801, provided Ferrari with second place in the constructors championship
1960 - 246 P F1 - the first mid-engined Ferrari F1 car - provided Ferrari with third place in the constructors championship
1966 - 246 F1 (should be 312?) - a win at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix enabled Ferrari to finish second in the constructors championship
1971 - 312 B2 - 1971 started with a win by new signing Mario Andretti, followed by another win for Jacky Ickx - Ferrari came second in the Constructors Championship
1969 - 312 F1 - During 1969 Enzo Ferrari set about spending his newfound wealth (from the sale of the road car business to Fiat) to revive his struggling team; though Ferrari did compete in Formula One in 1969, it was something of a throwaway season while the team was restructured
1997 - F310 B - driven by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine to second place in the constructors championship - Schumacher was actually disqualified from the drivers championship for causing an avoidable accident
2002 - F2002 - one of the most successful Formula One car designs of all time - designed by Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Paolo Martinelli, it won fifteen Grands Prix, from a total of nineteen races in 2002 and 2003

246 P F1 - Ferrari's first mid-engined F1 car, using a Dino 2417cc engine.
312 F1 - the 312 designation refers to the fact that the car had a 3 litre, 12 cylinder engine - the first year of the 312, 1966, saw a "return to power" in F1.
158 - the successor to the V6 powered 156, the 158 utilised the V8 permitted by the 1964 regulations.

Gilles Villeneuve drove in F1 from 1977 until his death in May 1982.  Villeneuve started driving for McLaren in 1977, but switched to Ferrari towards the end of that season.  Villeneuve remained with Ferrari for the rest of his F1 career.  He won six Grand Prix races in his F1 career.  In 1979 he finished second by four points in the championship to team-mate Jody Scheckter.

On May 8, 1982, Villeneuve died after an accident during the final qualifying session for the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder.  With eight minutes of the session left, Villeneuve came over the rise after the first chicane and caught Jochen Mass travelling much more slowly through the left-handed bend before the Terlamenbocht corner.  Mass saw Villeneuve approaching at high speed and moved to the right to let him through on the racing line.  At the same instant Villeneuve also moved right to pass the slower car.  The Ferrari hit the back of Mass' car and was launched into the air at a speed estimated at 120-140 mph.  It was airborne for over 100m before nosediving into the ground and disintegrating as it somersaulted along the edge of the track.  At the time of his death, Villeneuve was extremely popular with fans and has since become an iconic figure in the history of the sport.  His son, Jacques Villeneuve, became Formula One world champion in 1997 and to date is the only Canadian to win the Formula One World Championship.

A commemorative sheet featuring the Ferrari 126 C3.

The Ferrari 126 C was Ferrari's first attempt at a turbo engine Formula 1 car - it was used in 1981.  The C3 was an evolution of that car for 1983.  In that year, mandatory flat bottoms for the cars were introduced, to reduce the ground effect.  To compensate for the lost downforce, the car was designed with an oversized rear wing.  The power from the engine was also boosted - this car probably had the most powerful engine on the grid in 1983.

Ferrari won the constructors' championship with this car, their drivers were both in contention for the drivers' championship, but reliability issues meant that they lost out.

At the same time Stewart drove in the Can-Am series, finishing third in that series.  The stress of racing year round and on several continents caused medical problems for Stewart in the 1972 season.

A mini sheet of six values featuring the following Ferrari F1 cars:

- Ferrari 125 F1 - the 125 F1 was Ferrari's first f1 car, its best result came at the 1950 Monaco grand prix when Alberto Ascari drove it to second place - the 125 F1 used a supercharged 1.5 L V12 engine and sported a steel tube-frame chassis with longitudinal and cross members, it had a double wishbone suspension with a transverse leaf spring in front and a torsion bar in the rear which was upgraded to a de Dion tube for 1950, worm and sector steering and four-wheel drum brakes were the norm for the time.

- Ferrari 625 F1 - the 625 was a modified version of the hugely successful Ferrari 500 chassis, following a return to F1 engine regulations in 1954 - used in 1954 and 1955, it won one race in each season, despite not being quite as fast as the Maserati and Mercedes-Benz cars of the time

- Ferrari 312B - the 312B was the first of series of F1 cars used from 1970 to 1975

The Ferrari 312T was used in various versions from 1975 to 1980; it was an uncomplicated and clean design that responded to mechanical upgrades.

The 312T series won 27 races, four constructors' championships and three drivers' championships.

The car was powered by the ultra-reliable flat-12 engine which gave around 510bhp, the 'T' in the name stood for transverse, as the gearbox was mounted in this way, improving the car's handling characteristics, which had been the downfall of its predecessor.

The Lotus 79 is considered by many to be one of the most significant and respected racing car designs of all time.

It was the first car to take full advantage of ground effects aerodynamics, pioneered in its immediate predecessor, the Lotus 78.

The 79 proved to be almost unbeatable during the 1978 F1 season and provided an unprecedented level of domination.  The car took six victories during the season, giving the drivers' championship to Andretti and the constructors' championship to Lotus.

The McLaren MP4/2 was a F1 car designed by John Barnard of McLaren for the 1984 season.

The MP4/2 was one of the few F1 cars to use carbon brakes at the time, giving it another major advantage over most of its rivals on all bar street circuits or when conditions were hot and dry; notably, the carbon brakes weren't as good as the steel brakes at tracks like the Detroit and Dallas street circuits due to the steel brakes lasting longer in the heat.  That, combined to superior fuel consumption of the allowed 220 litres and the driving skill of Lauda and Prost saw the MP4/2 score 12 wins in 1984, at the time the highest number of wins in a season by a single team.

The Williams FW07 was a ground effect F1 car designed by Patrick Head for the 1979 F1 season.  It was closely based on the Lotus 79, even being developed in the same wind tunnel at Imperial College London.  The car was small and simple and extremely light, it was powered by the ubiquitous Ford Cosworth DFV.

Early reliability problems halted any serious threat to the title.  It was driven by Clay Regazzoni and Alan Jones; Regazzoni took Williams' first win at the British Grand Prix.  Jones went on to win four of the next five races, giving Williams a second place in the constructors' championship.

For 1980, it was developed in to the FW07B, Regazzoni was replaced by Carlos Reutemann.  In 1980, Williams won both titles for the first time, Alan Jnes being their first drivers' champion.

In the 1990 race, the real battle ended up being for second place between Mansell and Berger.  It culminated in Mansell's legendary pass around the outside of Berger going into the ultra-fast Peraltada corner.  Some called it brave, some called it suicidal, either way Mansell finished second.

A sheet of 4 diamond shaped stamps showing some Ferrari cars from 1960 to 1970.

The Ferrari 312B was a series of Formula One racing car models, designed and built by Scuderia Ferrari. It was the successor to the Ferrari 312 and was used from 1970 until early 1975. Several versions were made: the 312B, 312B2 and 312B3. The 312 B3, based on a prototype called "snow plough" was introduced in 1974 and was driven by former BRM drivers Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni.  The car was succeeded by the 312T which was introduced for 1975.

The 312T3 was introduced for Gilles Villeneuve and Carlos Reutemann at the third race of the 1978 season.  The car featured the same flat 12 engine as had been used since 1970, albeit tuned to give around 515bhp. The chassis was completely new, with a new monocoque structure and a different suspension arrangement, designed to work with the Michelin tyres. The bodywork visibly very different, with a flatter top to the body, allowing improved air flow to the rear wing.

All the hard work came to nothing though as the pioneering Lotus 79 ground effect "wing car" took on and beat all comers with ease that season, and Ferrari were left to pick up the pieces of any Lotus failures. Reutemann won 4 races, whilst Villeneuve won for the first time at the final race, his home race in Canada, but it was more a season of consolidation. Reutemann moved to Lotus for 1979, replaced by Jody Scheckter. Ferrari was only 3rd in the Constructors Championship.

A sheet of 4 diamond shaped stamps showing some Ferrari cars from 1980 to 1990.

The Ferrari F1/87/88C was driven in 1988 by Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger. It came second to McLaren in the Constructors Championship, scoring one pole position at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone and one victory at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. Although it was the most powerful car of the 1988 field at around 720 bhp, the F1/87/88C's biggest problem was fuel consumption compared to the rival Honda engines used by McLaren.

The Ferrari F399 was designed by Rory Byrne for the 1999 season, it allowed Ferrari to take their first constructor's title since 1983.  It was driven by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine.

The Ferrari F92A was driven, in 1992, by Jean Alesi, and by Ivan Capelli (for most of the season, before he was sacked and replaced by Nicola Larini). The car was most famous for its "double-flat bottom" floor that made it difficult to drive. The car only achieved two podiums and a total of 21 points. The best results were two third places by Jean Alesi.

The Ferrari 126C4 was used for the 1984 season, being driven by Michele Alboreto and Rene Arnoux.  It was no match for the dominant McLaren MP4/2, however.  The 126C4 was the last of the 126C series which replaced the successful 312T series cars; the 126C was Ferrari's first attempt at a turbo car.

A sheet of 4 diamond shaped stamps showing some Ferrari cars of the 21st century.

The Ferrari F2001 was a highly successful F1 car, designed by Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne for 2001. The car was designed around new regulation changes which mandated a higher mounted front wing assembly to reduce downforce. This resulted in a distinctive 'droopsnoot' nose and spoon shaped front wing. That season also saw the re-introduction of traction and launch control systems, and the car and its suspension were designed with this in mind.

The car was something of a departure over previous Brawn/Byrne Ferrari designs, being more based on McLaren's design thinking. The car did feature Ferrari trademarks, such as the periscope exhausts pioneered by the team in 1998 and the small bargeboards which were a feature of its predecessors. The F2001 used the same basic gearbox and internal layout as its predecessors, however the aerodynamic efficiency and tyre wear were improved considerably over previous Ferraris.

The F2001 took 10 wins, 13 pole positions, 4 fastest laps and 197 points in its career.

After 6 straight seasons of Ferrari winning the constructors championship, and five straight drivers championships, the F2005 was not a successful car, and Ferrari scored their lowest result in the constructors since 1995. The general consensus was that the main reason for Ferrari's lack of form was down to the Bridgestone tyres the team used, which were poor in comparison to the Michelin tyres that were used by the majority of teams. The best result achieved all season was a first and second placed finish at the United States Grand Prix, where, due to Michelin claiming that their tyres were unsafe, only six cars competed (Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi all raced on Bridgestone tyres, the tyre they had been using all season). This was to be Ferrari's and Michael Schumacher's only race win of the season.
