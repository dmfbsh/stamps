Official Monaco Postal Service commemorative stamp issue first day cover featuring 1.20 Euro stamp issued to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the first Monaco Grand Prix.

Created by the Prince Louis II under the impetus given by Antony Noghes, the "Grand- Prix of Monaco" is now a world-famous event, particularly appreciated by the drivers. After an interruption due to the wars, the 62nd Formula 1 Grand Prix will be held from 20th till 23rd May 2004.

One of the most eventful races of the 2004 season, the Monaco Grand Prix saw Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher qualify in fourth place (his time was actually fifth best; his brother Ralf qualified second, but was dropped ten places as a penalty for changing engines). Renault driver Jarno Trulli took his first pole position and made it his first race win, breaking the elder Schumacher's streak of race wins; Jenson Button (BAR Honda) was second and Rubens Barrichello (Ferrari) third.

<i>Issue date: 2011</i><br/><br/>
A single stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of Juan Manuel Fangio's birth (24th June 1911 - 17th July 1995).

He was nicknamed El Chueco ("knock-kneed") or El Maestro ("The Master"), and dominated the first decade of F1 racing.  He won five F1 World Driver's Championships - a record which stood for 46 years until eventually beaten by Michael Schumacher - with four different teams (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati), a feat that has not been repeated since.  Many still consider him to be the greatest driver of all time.  He has the highest winning percentage in F1 (46.15%) compared to Michael Schumacher's 33.83%.
 
He is the only Argentine driver to have won the Argentine Grand Prix, having won it four times in his career.

The Automobile Club de Monaco is a motoring club based in Monaco.  The club serves as the governing body for motorsport within Monaco, and organises the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and Monte Carlo Rally.  It is a member of the FIA, representing Monaco as a mobility and sporting club.

The Club was founded in 1890 as an association of cyclists, and began to incorporate motorists in 1907.  Antony Noghes, the son of the Club's president, organised the inaugural Monaco Grand Prix in 1929 on a circuit around the streets of Monaco, which caused the ACM to be admitted to the AIACR (the forerunner of the FIA) after it had previously been refused entry.

In 2015, World Champion Lewis Hamilton secured his first ever Monaco pole position during Saturday's qualifying.  In the race, Nico Rosberg took his third consecutive win at Monaco, second win of the season, and the tenth of his career, while Sebastian Vettel finished second.  Championship leader Hamilton, who had led for most of the race, moved from first into third place following a "pit stop misjudgement" during a late safety car period, for which his team, Mercedes, later apologised.  The renewed McLaren-Honda partnership scored its first points since Honda's return to the sport.

At the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, Peterson's Lotus involved in a multiple car accident running hard into the barriers and catching fire.  Trapped in a burning wreck Peterson was pulled free by Hunt, Regazzoni and Depailler before he received more than minor burns, but with severe leg injuries.  As Peterson's life was not seen to be any danger focus turned to another trapped driver.  Peterson died the following day in hospital

Peterson ran a total of 123 Grand Prix races during his career, winning ten of them

At his funeral, the pallbearers included Ken Tyrrell, Colin Chapman, James Hunt, Jody Scheckter, John Watson, Emerson Fittipaldi, Gunnar Nilsson and Niki Lauda

In 1979, George Harrison paid tribute to him with a song and music video called "Faster".

The Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus was founded in Paris on 20 June 1904, as an association of national motor clubs.  The association was designed to represent the interests of motor car users, as well as to oversee the burgeoning international motor sport scene.  In 1922, the AIACR delegated the organisation of automobile racing to the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI), which would set the regulations for international Grand Prix motor racing.

Upon the resumption of motor racing after the Second World War, the AIACR was renamed as the Ferderation Internationale de l'Automobile.  The FIA established a number of new racing categories, among them Formulas One and Two, and created the first World Championship, the Formula One World Drivers' Championship, in 1950.

A single stamp featuring the Ferrari 156.  The Ferrari 156 was built to comply with the then-new F1 regulations that reduced engine displacement from 2.5- to 1.5-litres, similar to the pre-1961 F2 class for which Ferrari had developed a mid-engined car also called the 156.

Phil Hill won the 1961 drivers' championship and Ferrari secured the 1961 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, both victories achieved with the 156.

The 1961 version of the 156 was affectionately dubbed "sharknose" due to its characteristic air intake "nostrils".

A single stamp featuring James Hunt and McLaren.  Hunt drove for McLaren in the 1976, 1977 and 1978 seasons, driving the McLaren M23 and M26.  The 1976 season proved to be one of the most dramatic and controversial on record.  While Hunt's performances in the preceding three seasons at Hesketh had drawn considerable praise, there was some conjecture as to whether he could really sustain a championship challenge.  In 1976 he became a works McLaren driver, and quickly dispelled many doubters at the first race in Brazil, where, in a hastily rebuilt McLaren M23, he landed pole position in the last minutes of qualifying.  Following a dramatic season, Hunt took the drivers' title in 1976.

A single stamp featuring the Lotus 49.

The Lotus 49 was a F1 racing car designed by Colin Chapman and Maurice Philippe for the 1967 F1 season.  It was designed around the Cosworth DFV engine that would power most of the grid through the 1970s.  It was one of the first F1 cars to use a stressed-member drivetrain to reduce weight, and the first to be widely copied by other teams.

Jim Clark won on the car's debut, in 1967, and it would also provide him with the last win of his career, in 1968.  Graham Hill went on to win that year's title and the car continued winning races until 1970.

A single stamp featuring the Renault RS01.

The Renault RS01 was the first F1 car to be powered by a turbocharged engine, it was also the first to use radial tyres, which were provided by Michelin.  The rules of F1 at the time permitted 3.0 litre engines of natural aspiration, with a clause for a 1.5 litre supercharged or turbocharged engine.  All of the teams kept initially to the 3.0 litre specification (retaining the Ford Coswrth DFV engines, or continuing to develop in-house flat 12 engines).

The car was used from 1977 to 1979, first appearing at the 10th round of the 1977 season at Silverstone.  The car proved to be very unreliable, it was cumbersome and overweight - in reality it was little more than an experimental test car.  The car was nicknamed ' the yellow teapot' by rival teams.  Out of 26 starts, it retired 19 times, and only once scored points.

The chassis continued to be used by privateer teams in 1964 and 1965.

<i>Issue date: 27th March 2020</i><br/><br/>
A single stamp featuring Niki Lauda, 22nd February 1949 to 20th May 2019.

Lauda is a three-time Drivers' Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984.  He is the only driver in F1 history to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors.  He is widely considered one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time.

Lauda was seriously injured in a crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring during which his Ferrari 312T2 burst into flames, and he came close to death after inhaling hot toxic fumes and suffering severe burns.  He raced again just six weeks later at the Italian Grand Prix.

In September 2012 he was appointed non-executive chairman of the Mercedes F1 Team.  He took part in negotiations to sign Lewis Hamilton to a three-year deal with Mercedes.

<i>Issue date: 4th March 2020</i><br/><br/>
A single stamp featuring the McLaren M23.

The M23 was introduced for the 1973 season and was used by McLaren up to and including the 1977 season.  With this car, McLaren achieved three third places, one second place and one first place in the Constructors' Championship.

A total of 13 chassis were built, with serial numbers 1 to 12 and 14.  No number 13 chassis was built, as it was deemed to be unlucky.

The M23 was never the most technically advanced F1 car, but sound preparation and continual development helped it win 16 Grands Prix, two Drivers' and one Constructors' Championships in its lifetime.
