Jordan / Formula 1 Racing (1991-2004) - Smilers Sheetlet - limited edition of 950.

Jordan Grand Prix was a Formula One constructor that competed from 1991 to 2005. The team is named after Irish businessman and founder Eddie Jordan. Jordan and his team were well known for a "rock and roll" attitude which added colour and character to Formula One in the 1990s.

In early 2005, the team was sold to Midland Group, who competed for one final season as 'Jordan', before renaming the team as MF1 Racing for the 2006 season, before being sold later in 2006 to Dutch car manufacturer Spyker Cars to become Spyker F1 for 2007, and then sold again to become Force India in 2008.

1999 was the team's finest season, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, joined Damon Hill as their second driver. The season was a nightmare for Hill, who was to retire at the end of the 1999 season. However, Frentzen's season was immensely successful, with the German earning two victories and a pole position. For a short while Frentzen had entertained thoughts of a world title, but poor luck and greater speed from McLaren and Ferrari ended his hopes. Frentzen finished third in the Drivers' Championship and the team also finished third amongst the Constructors'.

"Smilers" are sheets of 10 to 20 stamps, each accompanied by a perforated tab, which is designed for a personalized photo image.  The British Post Office entered the personalized stamp market in 2000, at the Stamp Show 2000, held in Earl's Court, London. They prepared five sheets of 10 stamps for personalized photographs. These comprised the "Clown", the "Mona Lisa", "Dennis the Menace", the "Policeman", and the "Teddy Bear" from the 1991 "Famous Smiles" greetings booklet issue. They also prepared a special commemorative sheet of 10 with generic tabs to promote the show. This sheet was based upon the complete 10-stamp issue of this "Famous Smiles" booklet, and thus the name "Smilers" was adopted by the British Post Office.

<i>Issue date: 21st July 2007</i><br/><br/>
A set of 6 stamps commemorating some of Britain's most notable F1 drivers, ranging from Stirling Moss in the 1950s to Nigel Mansell in the 1980s.

The six stamps, in varying denominations, depict Moss in his 1957 Vanwall, Graham Hill in his 1962 BRM, Jim Clark in his 1963 Lotus, Jackie Stewart in his 1973 Tyrell, James Hunt in his 1976 McLaren and Nigel Mansell in his 1986 Williams. The stamps were timed to capitalize on Lewis Hamilton's home grand prix at Silverstone.

As a matter of protocol no British stamp can depict the face a living person other than the monarch, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, which explains why the cars are pictured from above, revealing only the tops of the drivers' helmets.

The stamps have caused some controversy as they celebrate one driver -- Stirling Moss -- who never won a world championship, while omitting Mike Hawthorn, the first British driver to win the title, and Damon Hill, the last British driver to win the title.

The set consists of the presentation pack and various first day covers (signed by Nico Rosberg, Alex Wurz - the Williams drivers for 2007, and Ross Brawn, Adrian Newey and Patrick Head).
