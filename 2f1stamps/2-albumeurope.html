The race was subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government.  In response, Red Bull Racing and Mercedes team principals Christian Horner and Toto Wolff sought to distance the sport from political issues.

The organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written an open letter to him to which Ecclestone had not replied.  Sport for Rights made it clear that they did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public.

<i>Issue date: 1996</i><br/><br/>
The first motor races were held in the Belgian Ardennes in 1896, and from 1902 races on a closed part of the public roads were held - this is the first time public roads were used.  At this time, different layouts were used each year, the longest being 73.8 miles.

The first circuit was designed in 1920 by Jules de Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem, the original triangle-shaped course used public roads between the Belgian towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy, and Stavelot.  The first car race was held in 1922 and the first Grand Prix in 1925.

Spa was a very fast circuit and it had a nasty reputation for being dangerous and very fast - it was a circuit known to be one for the brave, and most drivers were frightened of it.

The original length of the circuit was 15km, the configuration of the circuit was changed many times over the years - the biggest change came in 1979 when the circuit was shortened from 14km to 7km.

The circuit probably demonstrates the importance of driver skill more than any other in the world. This is largely due to the Eau Rouge and Blanchimont corners, both which need to be taken flat out to achieve a fast run onto the straights after them, which aids a driver in both a fast lap and in overtaking.

A set of 4 values, showing the following Ferrari F1 cars:

1954 625 F1 - in 1954, F1 regulations returned and the 625 was the Ferrari 500 chassis but with the now permitted 2.5litre engine, this car helped Jose Froilan Gonzalez and Mike Hawthorn to second and third places in the championship behind Juan Manuel Fangio in the Maserati
1970 312 B - driven by Jacky Ickx, Ignazio Giunti and Clay Regazzoni, Ferrari came second in the constructors championship behind the dominant Lotus
1978 312 T3 - driven by Carlos Reutemann and Gilles Villeneuve, the T3 featured the same flat 12 engine as previous 312's, but had an all new monocoque and suspension allowing improved air flow to the rear wing, the T3 was no match for the Lotus pioneering ground effect car and again came second in the constructors championship
1983 126 C3 - mandatory flat bottoms for the cars were introduced for 1983, reducing ground effect, and the 126C3 was designed with this in mind, Harvey Poslethwaite designed an over-sized but effective rear wing which clawed back around 50% of the lost downforce, whilst further compensation came from the engineers who boosted the power of the engine even further, this allowed Patrick Tambay and Rene Arnoux to take Ferrari to the constructors title

<i>Issue date: 16th October 2008</i><br/><br/>
A pair of stamps showing the Ferrari F1 cars from 1952 and 2008.

In 1952, a number of entrants used various Ferrari chassis - the 500, 375, 212, 125 and 166.  The most popular was the 500.  In 1952, the championship was run for Formula 2 specifications.  Ferrari were the only team to have a car specifically designed for the new formula.  The car was powered by a in line four cylinder engine which was mounted behind the front axle, improving weight distribution.  Alberto Ascari won 9 straight races in the 500, a world championship record which still stands today.  The 500 won all but one race it was entered in, making it the second most statistically successful car in the history of the FIA world championship, after McLaren MP4/4 which failed to win only one of its 16 races.

In 2008, Ferrari competed the F1 season with the F2008.  It featured a new standard Electronic Control Unit (ECU), produced by McLaren Electronic Systems.  This was included to comply with the new regulations.  The ECU also removed most of the driver aids used in previous seasons, including traction control, engine braking and electronically assisted starting system.  It also made the management of the differential, engine and gear changes easier.  The car also weighed more than the previous season's F2007 chassis due to rule changes which included the gearbox which had to be used for four consecutive races and higher side protection around the drivers helmet.  The F2008 won 8 races of the season giving Ferrari the constructors title.

Finland's postal service celebrates the success of the country's reigning Formula One world champion, Kimi Raikkonen, with a special sheet of stamps. The stamps, released as part of a series to help mark the Finnish postal service's 370th birthday, include images of Raikkonen on track for Ferrari and on the podium celebrating victory at the 2008 Malaysian Grand Prix. The pictures are accompanied by the text 'F1 World Champion '07 Kimi Raikkonen'. Raikkonen will be presented with his own special copy of the stamps on September 4 - a day before their official release - at Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps circuit, immediately ahead of that weekend's Belgian Grand Prix.

A single stamp featuring Alain Prost.

Prost competed in F1 from 1980 to 1993; he won the drivers' championship four times.  During his F1 career he drove for McLaren, Renault, Ferrari and Williams.

Prost had a smooth, relaxed driving style; he would conserve his brakes and tyres early in the race to enable him to mount a challenge later in the race.  His approach to competition earned him the nickname "The Professor".

A commemorative pack featuring Michael Schumacher.

In 1998, Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen became Schumacher's main title competition.  Hakkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16 point advantage over Schumacher.  With the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher won six races and had five other podium finishes.  Ferrari took a 1-2 finish at the Italian Grand Prix, which tied Schumacher with Hakkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points, but Hakkinen won the Championship by winning the final two races.  There were two controversies; at the British Grand Prix Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start finish line and stopped for a ten second stop go penalty.  There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but the win stood.  At Spa, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past.  After both cars returned to the pits, Schumacher rushed to McLaren's garage and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him.

Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors title in 1999.  He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix: at the high-speed Stowe Corner, his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track and resulting in a broken leg.

<i>Issue date: 29th July 1951</i><br/><br/>
A single stamp commemorating the 14th German Grand Prix, held at the Nurburgring Nordschleife on 29th July 1951.

The race was won by Alberto Ascari (Ferrari), Juan Manuel Fangio (Alfa Romeo) was second and Jose Frolian Gonzalez (Ferrari) was third.  The race was 20 laps of the 14 mile course.

Alfa Romeo fielded four cars, with local driver Paul Pietsch replacing Consalvo Sanesi, joining Fangio, Farina and Bonetto. Following on from their maiden victory at Silverstone, Ferrari also entered four drivers. Piero Taruffi rejoined their lineup, alongside Ascari, Villoresi and British Grand Prix winner Jose Froilan Gonzalez. Ferrari continued their good form from the previous event, with Ascari and Gonzalez the fastest two qualifiers. Fangio and Farina completed the front row, with Villoresi, Taruffi and Pietsch making up the second row.

Nino Farina initially took the lead, but, by the end of the first lap, had been passed by Fangio, Ascari and Gonzalez. Paul Pietsch was running in fifth, but ended up at the back of the field after going off on the second lap. When Farina was forced to retire due to overheating problems, Fangio was left as the sole Alfa Romeo able to take the fight to the Ferrari drivers. Alberto Ascari took the lead on the fifth lap as a result of Fangio's first pitstop, but Fangio returned to the lead when Ascari took to the pits. As the Alfas required two pitstops, as opposed to just one for the Ferraris, Fangio needed to build a large lead in his second stint if he wanted to retain the lead after his second stop. He was unable to do so, therefore Ascari reclaimed the lead on the fifteenth lap of the race. Due to a misbehaving engine, Fangio was unable to take advantage of an unexpected tyre change for Ascari, meaning that the Italian took his maiden World Championship race victory by over half a minute from Fangio. Gonzalez completed the podium, with the remaining points positions going to the other works Ferraris of Villoresi and Taruffi.

Ascari's victory took him to second in the Championship standings, ten points adrift of Fangio, who extended his lead from the previous race. After his second consecutive podium, Jose Froilan Gonzalez moved up to third in the standings, level on points with Farina and Villoresi.

A set of 6 stamps commemorating some of Britain's most notable F1 drivers, ranging from Stirling Moss in the 1950s to Nigel Mansell in the 1980s.

The six stamps, in varying denominations, depict Moss in his 1957 Vanwall, Graham Hill in his 1962 BRM, Jim Clark in his 1963 Lotus, Jackie Stewart in his 1973 Tyrell, James Hunt in his 1976 McLaren and Nigel Mansell in his 1986 Williams. The stamps were timed to capitalize on Lewis Hamilton's home grand prix at Silverstone.

As a matter of protocol no British stamp can depict the face a living person other than the monarch, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, which explains why the cars are pictured from above, revealing only the tops of the drivers' helmets.

The stamps have caused some controversy as they celebrate one driver -- Stirling Moss -- who never won a world championship, while omitting Mike Hawthorn, the first British driver to win the title, and Damon Hill, the last British driver to win the title.

The set consists of the presentation pack and various first day covers (signed by Nico Rosberg, Alex Wurz - the Williams drivers for 2007, and Ross Brawn, Adrian Newey and Patrick Head).

Jordan / Formula 1 Racing (1991-2004) - Smilers Sheetlet - limited edition of 950.

Jordan Grand Prix was a Formula One constructor that competed from 1991 to 2005. The team is named after Irish businessman and founder Eddie Jordan. Jordan and his team were well known for a "rock and roll" attitude which added colour and character to Formula One in the 1990s.

In early 2005, the team was sold to Midland Group, who competed for one final season as 'Jordan', before renaming the team as MF1 Racing for the 2006 season, before being sold later in 2006 to Dutch car manufacturer Spyker Cars to become Spyker F1 for 2007, and then sold again to become Force India in 2008.

1999 was the team's finest season, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, joined Damon Hill as their second driver. The season was a nightmare for Hill, who was to retire at the end of the 1999 season. However, Frentzen's season was immensely successful, with the German earning two victories and a pole position. For a short while Frentzen had entertained thoughts of a world title, but poor luck and greater speed from McLaren and Ferrari ended his hopes. Frentzen finished third in the Drivers' Championship and the team also finished third amongst the Constructors'.

"Smilers" are sheets of 10 to 20 stamps, each accompanied by a perforated tab, which is designed for a personalized photo image.  The British Post Office entered the personalized stamp market in 2000, at the Stamp Show 2000, held in Earl's Court, London. They prepared five sheets of 10 stamps for personalized photographs. These comprised the "Clown", the "Mona Lisa", "Dennis the Menace", the "Policeman", and the "Teddy Bear" from the 1991 "Famous Smiles" greetings booklet issue. They also prepared a special commemorative sheet of 10 with generic tabs to promote the show. This sheet was based upon the complete 10-stamp issue of this "Famous Smiles" booklet, and thus the name "Smilers" was adopted by the British Post Office.

He clinched a record seventh drivers' title at the Belgian Grand Prix. He finished that season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up, teammate Rubens Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the 2002 season.

The Lotus 18 was designed by Colin Chapman; it was the first mid-engined car built by Lotus.  It was introduced for the 1960 F1 season.

The car took Lotus' first F1 victory, by Innes Ireland in the non-championship Glover Trophy, on 8th April 1960.  Its first World Championship win happened six weeks later, on 29th May, albeit by privateer Rob Walker, who leased the car from Chapman.  Driven by Stirling Moss the car took a dominant win at the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix.  Moss also won the United States Grand Prix at the end of the season helping Lotus finish second in the constructors' championship.

Moss repeated his win in a legendary race at Monaco the following year, beating off the more powerful and faster 'sharknose' Ferraris.  He then won at the fearsome Nurburgring in changeable weather, while Innes Ireland took a third win in the USA to help Lotus finish second in the constructors' championship in 1961.  The Lotus 18 was also notable for giving Jim Clark his first Grand Prix start in 1960.

A single stamp issued to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Hungarian grand prix.

The 2006 race was the first ever wet Hungarian grand prix.

Jenson Button (Honda) won the race despite beginning in 14th place, with Pedro de la Rosa (McLaren) scoring his first podium with second place, and Nick Heidfeld getting BMW Sauber's first ever podium with 3rd.  Debutant driver Robert Kubica (BMW Sauber) finished in seventh place and scored two points, but was later disqualified as his car was underweight due to excessive tire wear.  This coincidentally meant that Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) earned a point despite not finishing, as he was elevated to 8th place in the final results.

This was Jenson Button's first victory of his career and the first race win for a British driver since David Coulthard won the Australian Grand Prix three years previously, and the first by an Englishman since Johnny Herbert won the 1999 European Grand Prix nearly seven years previously, in similarly changeable weather circumstances.

A stamp issued to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

The first Hungarian Grand Prix was held on 21st June 1936 over a 3.1-mile track laid out in Nepliget, a park in Budapest.  The Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, and Ferrari teams all sent three cars and the event drew a very large crowd.  However, politics and the ensuing war meant the end of Grand Prix motor racing in the country for fifty years.

A major coup by Bernie Ecclestone, the 1986 Hungarian Grand Prix was the first Formula One race to take place behind the Iron Curtain.  Held at the twisty Hungaroring in Mogyorod near Budapest, the race has been a mainstay of the racing calendar.  Run in the heat of a central European summer, it also held the distinction of being the only current Grand Prix venue that had never seen a wet race up until the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.

The 1986 race was won by Nelson Piquet (Williams-Honda), Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault) was second and Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda) was third.  Nelson Piquet's overtake of Ayrton Senna is considered one of the most beautiful ever in racing history.

The 2010 race was won by Mark Weber (Red Bull-Renault), Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) was second and Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull-Renault) was third.

The Grand Prix was organised by the Automobile Club de France (ACF) at the prompting of the French automobile industry as an alternative to the Gordon Bennett races (as France had the largest automobile industry in Europe at the time).  This first Grand Prix was won by Ferenc Szisz driving a Renault.

1992 would be Mansell's finest season, these stamps celebrate him becoming World Champion. He started the year with five straight victories (a record equalled by Michael Schumacher in 2004). At Monaco, the sixth race of the season, he took pole and dominated much of the race. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton Senna's McLaren-Honda. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna's and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just two tenths of a second behind the Brazilian. Mansell was crowned Formula One Drivers' Champion early in the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where his second place finish clinched the Drivers' Championship, securing the title in the least number of Grands Prix since the 16-race season format started. This stood as a record until broken by Schumacher in 2002. Mansell also set the then-record for the most number of wins in one season (9) and highest number of pole positions (14).

Mike Hailwood was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer regarded by many as one of the greatest racers of all time.  He became one of the few men to compete at Grand Prix level in both motorcycle and car racing.

In F1, Hailwood drove for Reg Parnell Racing in 1963, 1964 and 1965 without much success.  In 1971, 1972 and 1973 he drove for Team Surtees, again more often than not retiring from races.  However, in 1972 he achieved his best result in F1 coming second at the Italian Grand Prix.  In his final season of F1, 1974, he drove for McLaren, and finished 11th in the Drivers' Championship.  He left Formula One after being injured badly at the 1974 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, so did complete the season with McLaren.

Hailwood was recognised for his bravery when in the 1973 South African Grand Prix he went to pull Clay Regazzoni from his burning car after the two collided on the second lap of the race.  Hailwood's driving suit caught fire, but after being extinguished by a fire marshall he returned to help rescue Regazzoni, an act for which he was awarded the George Medal, the 2nd highest gallantry award that a British civilian can be awarded.

A mini sheet of four values commemorating Enzo Ferrari (18th February 1898 to 14th August 1988).

Ferrari has participated in the F1 World Championship since its introduction in 1950 but the first victory was not until the British Grand Prix of 1951.  The first championship came in 1952-53, when the Formula One season was raced with Formula Two cars.

In 1923, racing in Ravenna for Alfa Romeo, he acquired the Prancing Horse badge which decorated the fuselage of Francesco Baracca's (Italy's leading ace of WWI) SPAD S.XIII fighter, given from his mother, taken from the wreckage of the plane after his mysterious death.  This icon would have to wait until 1932 to be displayed on a racing car.

As Ferry Porsche stated in his autobiography "Mein Leben", the Prancing Horse is, in fact, the coat of arms of the city of Stuttgart.  It is not from a German plane Baracca shot down - it was emblazoned on his aircraft in tribute to his past cavalry unit, and later presented to Ferrari by Baracca's family.

A postcard commemorating the 60th Anniversary of the Death of Achille Varzi.

Achille Varzi was a Grand Prix driver in the 1930s and 1940s and so was not an F1 driver.  His legacy to the sport, however, was the introduction of the mandatory wearing of crash helmets.  At the 1948 Swiss Grand Prix as light rain fell on the Bremgarten track, his Alfa Romeo 158 skidded on the wet surface, flipping over and crushing him to death.  This resulted in the FIA mandating the use of crash helmets, which up until that point had been optional.

Michael Schumacher became Ferrari's first World Drivers Champion for 21 years. Schumacher clinched the drivers' title at the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Ferrari also successfully defended their constructors' title.

The season was marred by one death: a race marshal was killed at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The two Jordans collided on the approach to the Variante della Roggia chicane and slid into the cars ahead of them. The marshal was struck by a loose tyre from one of the Jordans. Michael Schumacher considered quitting the sport as this was the first death in F1 since driver Ayrton Senna's in 1994.

The race produced in a 1-2 result for the Ferraris of Rene Arnoux and Patrick Tambay, with John Watson third in a McLaren.  Derek Warwick's fourth-place finish resulted in the first points for both himself and the Toleman team.  The race was notable for a collision between the leader of the championship Alain Prost and the nearest challenger Nelson Piquet which immediately forced Piquet out of the race and caused Prost to retire shortly afterwards.  This was Rene Arnoux's 7th and last victory in F1.

The Dutch Grand Prix saw McLaren debut the new Porsche built TAG turbo V6 engine with Niki Lauda driving the new car and John Watson continuing with the Ford powered car.  After qualifying 19th Lauda's race ended on lap 25 with brake failure.  Watson's third place was the last time a naturally aspirated powered car would legally finish on a F1 podium until the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.  This would also prove to be the final time a McLaren used a naturally aspirated engine in a Grand Prix until the opening round of the 1989 season.

The Circuito da Boavista was a street circuit in Oporto, Portugal - it was used twice for F1 races in 1958 and 1960.

The 1958 event is remembered for an act of good sportsmanship by Stirling Moss.  Moss came to the defense of fellow countryman (and title rival) Mike Hawthorn, who had run afoul of the stewards (and oncoming traffic) during an off-track excursion during the race.  Moss (who won the race) persuaded the stewards not to disqualify Hawthorn, preserving second place, and 6 points, for Hawthorn, who would eventually win the drivers championship by 1 point over Moss.

The 1960 running was a race of attrition, with only four cars finishing within 5 laps of winner Jack Brabham.  Accidents and mechanical problems ended the day early for future champions John Surtees, Phil Hill, Graham Hill and others.

A single stamp featuring James Hunt and McLaren.  Hunt drove for McLaren in the 1976, 1977 and 1978 seasons, driving the McLaren M23 and M26.  The 1976 season proved to be one of the most dramatic and controversial on record.  While Hunt's performances in the preceding three seasons at Hesketh had drawn considerable praise, there was some conjecture as to whether he could really sustain a championship challenge.  In 1976 he became a works McLaren driver, and quickly dispelled many doubters at the first race in Brazil, where, in a hastily rebuilt McLaren M23, he landed pole position in the last minutes of qualifying.  Following a dramatic season, Hunt took the drivers' title in 1976.

Lauda was seriously injured in a crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring during which his Ferrari 312T2 burst into flames, and he came close to death after inhaling hot toxic fumes and suffering severe burns.  He raced again just six weeks later at the Italian Grand Prix.

In September 2012 he was appointed non-executive chairman of the Mercedes F1 Team.  He took part in negotiations to sign Lewis Hamilton to a three-year deal with Mercedes.

Phil Hill won the 1961 drivers' championship and Ferrari secured the 1961 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, both victories achieved with the 156.

The 1961 version of the 156 was affectionately dubbed "sharknose" due to its characteristic air intake "nostrils".

It was designed around the Cosworth DFV engine that would power most of the grid through the 1970s.  It was one of the first F1 cars to use a stressed-member drivetrain to reduce weight, and the first to be widely copied by other teams.

Jim Clark won on the car's debut, in 1967, and it would also provide him with the last win of his career, in 1968.  Graham Hill went on to win that year's title and the car continued winning races until 1970.

A single stamp featuring the Renault RS01.

The Renault RS01 was the first F1 car to be powered by a turbocharged engine, it was also the first to use radial tyres, which were provided by Michelin.  The rules of F1 at the time permitted 3.0 litre engines of natural aspiration, with a clause for a 1.5 litre supercharged or turbocharged engine.  All of the teams kept initially to the 3.0 litre specification (retaining the Ford Coswrth DFV engines, or continuing to develop in-house flat 12 engines).

The car was used from 1977 to 1979, first appearing at the 10th round of the 1977 season at Silverstone.  The car proved to be very unreliable, it was cumbersome and overweight - in reality it was little more than an experimental test car.  The car was nicknamed ' the yellow teapot' by rival teams.  Out of 26 starts, it retired 19 times, and only once scored points.

The Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus was founded in Paris on 20 June 1904, as an association of national motor clubs.  The association was designed to represent the interests of motor car users, as well as to oversee the burgeoning international motor sport scene.  In 1922, the AIACR delegated the organisation of automobile racing to the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI), which would set the regulations for international Grand Prix motor racing.

Upon the resumption of motor racing after the Second World War, the AIACR was renamed as the Ferderation Internationale de l'Automobile.  The FIA established a number of new racing categories, among them Formulas One and Two, and created the first World Championship, the Formula One World Drivers' Championship, in 1950.

The Automobile Club de Monaco is a motoring club based in Monaco.  The club serves as the governing body for motorsport within Monaco, and organises the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and Monte Carlo Rally.  It is a member of the FIA, representing Monaco as a mobility and sporting club.

The Club was founded in 1890 as an association of cyclists, and began to incorporate motorists in 1907.  Antony Noghes, the son of the Club's president, organised the inaugural Monaco Grand Prix in 1929 on a circuit around the streets of Monaco, which caused the ACM to be admitted to the AIACR (the forerunner of the FIA) after it had previously been refused entry.

In 2015, World Champion Lewis Hamilton secured his first ever Monaco pole position during Saturday's qualifying.  In the race, Nico Rosberg took his third consecutive win at Monaco, second win of the season, and the tenth of his career, while Sebastian Vettel finished second.  Championship leader Hamilton, who had led for most of the race, moved from first into third place following a "pit stop misjudgement" during a late safety car period, for which his team, Mercedes, later apologised.  The renewed McLaren-Honda partnership scored its first points since Honda's return to the sport.

A mini sheet of 12 values featuring various F1 cars through the ages of F1.

The history of Formula One has its roots in the European Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s.  However, the foundation of Formula One began in 1946 with the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA's) standardisation of rules.  A World Drivers' Championship followed in 1950.  The sport's history necessarily parallels the history of its technical regulations.  Although the world championship has always been the main focus of the category, non-championship Formula One races were held for many years.  Due to the rising cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.

Jordan Grand Prix was a Formula One constructor that competed from 1991 to 2005.  The team is named after Irish businessman and founder Eddie Jordan.  Jordan and his team were well known for a 'rock and roll' attitude which added colour and character to Formula One in the 1990s.  In 1998, the team made its biggest signing, former World Champion Damon Hill, a graduate of Jordan's F3000 programme.  This stamp celebrates Jordan's finest race result; at the 1998 rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix in which only six cars finished, Damon Hill earned Jordan their first ever Formula One win, which was also Hill's 22nd career Grand Prix victory. Ralf Schumacher sweetened the victory by finishing second. In 1998, Hill finished 6th in the driver's standings with Ralf 10th.

A single stamp commemorating 100 years of Grand Prix racing.

Grand Prix motor racing originated in France and the French Grand Prix, open to international competition, is the oldest Grand Prix race, first run on 26 June 1906 under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France in Sarthe.

The circuit used, which was based in Le Mans, was roughly triangular in shape, each lap covering 105 kilometres (65 miles).  Six laps were run each day, and each lap took approximately an hour to complete.

There were 32 entrants - the race was won by Hungarian Ferenc Szisz driving a Renault.

The Grand Prix name ("Great Prize") referred to the prize of 45,000 French francs paid to the race winner.

In 2006, the French Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari.

A mini sheet of 12 values commemorating Ferrari's 50 years in Formula 1 motor racing.

In 1947 Ferrari constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5 L Tipo 125, the first racing car to bear the Ferrari name.  The 125 won six of its fourteen races in 1947, though drivers Clemente Biondetti and Giuseppe Navone were unable to win the 1947 Mille Miglia in it.

Ferrari are the only team who have competed in every season of the Formula 1 world championship since its inception in 1950.  By 1997, Ferrari had won the constructor's championship 8 times.

In 1997, the Ferrari F310B with the Ferrari 046/2 3.0 V10 engine was driven by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine.  Both Ferrari and Schumacher came runner up in the respective championships, although Schumacher was later disqualified from the driver's championship for causing an avoidable accident.

The San Marino Grand Prix was a F1 championship race which was run at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the town of Imola, near the Apennine mountains in Italy, between 1981 and 2006.  It is called the San Marino Grand Prix because there is already an Italian Grand Prix, and the republic of San Marino is itself too small to host a grand prix.  In 1980, the Imola track was used for the 51st Italian Grand Prix.

The 1983 race was won by Patrick Tambay (Ferrari), Alain Prost (Renault) was second and in third pace was Rene Arnoux (Ferrari).

1962 Lotus 25.  The Lotus 25 was designed by Colin Chapman.  It was a revolutionary design, the first fully stressed monocoque chassis to appear in F1.  An early brainchild of Chapman's fertile mind, the original sketches for the car were made on napkins while Chapman discussed his idea while dining out with Lotus chassis designer Mike Costin.

The monocoque made the car more rigid and structurally stronger than typical F1 cars of the period.  The 25 was three times stiffer than the interim 21, while the chassis weighed only half as much.  As a result, the car was extremely low and narrow (frontal area only 8.0 ft squared, 0.74m squared compared to the normal 9.5 ft squared, 0.88 m squared).  To assist this, the driver reclined sharply behind the wheel (an idea seen in the 18, and pioneered over a decade previously by Gustav Baumm at NSU), leading to the nickname 'The Bathtub', while front suspension pieces were moved inboard.  The 25 was powered by a 1498cc Coventry Climax FWMV V8, although Reg Parnell Racing in 1964 fitted BRM P56s of similar specification to their second-hand 25s.  Such was 25's effect on motor racing, even today's modern F1 cars follow its basic principles.

1966 Brabham BT-19.  The Brabham BT19 was designed by Ron Tauranac for the British Brabham team.  The BT19 competed in the 1966 and 1967 Formula One World Championships and was used by Australian driver Jack Brabham to win his third World Championship in 1966.  The BT19, which Brabham referred to as his "Old Nail", was the first car bearing its driver's name to win a World Championship race.

The car was initially conceived in 1965 for a 1.5-litre Coventry Climax engine, but never raced in this form.  For the 1966 Formula One season the FIA doubled the limit on engine capacity to 3 litres.  Australian company Repco developed a new V8 engine for Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no time to develop a new car to handle it.  Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.

Only one BT19 was built.

1969 Matra MS80.  The Matra MS80 was the Ford Cosworth DFV-powered car (engine 3000 cc, estimated at around 420 bhp) that took Jackie Stewart to the Formula One World Championship title in 1969.  The chassis was built in the Matra's F1 base at Velizy-Villacoublay in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France.

Although officially a Matra, it was basically run by the non-works Matra team of Ken Tyrrell.  The MS80 was one of the first F1 racing cars to be designed with "wings" for downforce to increase high-speed tyre grip.  These were originally introduced into F1 in 1968.  Due to some serious racing accidents with the flimsy 1969-type high wing constructions early in the racing season, like all 1969 F1 cars the MS80 was altered to use more sturdy lowered wings, directly attached to the car's body, later on.

Only two MS80's were assembled in 1969, a third monocoque was built but remained un-assembled until the EPAF company made it a complete car in 2006.  Jackie Stewart in a 2006 issue of the British Motor Sport magazine referred to it as the nicest-handling F1 car he had ever driven.

1976 Ferrari 312T2.  The Ferrari 312T was based on the 312B3 from 1974.  In various versions, it was used from 1975 until 1980.  It was designed by Mauro Forghieri for the 1975 season and was an uncomplicated and clean design, that responded to mechanical upgrades.  The 312T series won 27 races, four constructors' and three drivers' championships, and was replaced for the 1981 season by the 126 C, Ferrari's first turbocharged F1 car.  The car was powered by the powerful and ultra reliable flat-12 engine which gave around 510bhp, the T in the name stood for 'transverse', as the gearbox was mounted in this way, improving the car's handling characteristics, which had been the downfall of its predecessor.

The 312T2 was launched at Fiorano and featured a number of modifications over the 312T.  In order to comply with the revised aerodynamic rules, the car no longer featured an airbox behind the cockpit.  Instead "NACA shaped" air intakes were incorporated into the cockpit sides, feeding air into each cylinder bank of the flat 12 engine.  At 2650mm, the wheelbase was 42mm longer than that of the 312T.

The 312T2 was if anything, more successful than the 312T.  Lauda was comfortably leading the world championship, when at the 1976 German Grand Prix at Nurburgring he had a massive accident caused by a suspected rear suspension failure.  In the aftermath he nearly burned to death, but was miraculously back racing just 6 weeks later.  Lauda conceded the title by just a single point to James Hunt (McLaren), but the 312T2's superiority helped Ferrari win its second consecutive constructor's title

1978 Lotus 79 MK4.  The Lotus 79 was the first F1 car to take full advantage of ground effects aerodynamics, pioneered in its immediate predecessor, the Lotus 78.  The undercar pressure problems in the 78 were resolved with the 79, with further design work on the venturi tunnels under the car, which allowed the low pressure area to be evenly spaced along the whole of the underside.  This was achieved by extending the rear bodywork to a point inside the rear wheels, allowing the underside to extend further back, instead of ending abruptly in front of the rear wheels on the 78.  As a result, the rear suspension was also redesigned to allow the air to exit the rear more cleanly than on its predecessor.  This allowed a smaller rear wing to be designed, causing less drag. When the car first appeared, the upper bodywork was steeply raked and featured Coke bottle sidepods.  After work in the wind tunnel, these features were found to be unnecessary, as the car generated so much downforce anyway.

The 79 proved to be almost unbeatable during the 1978 Formula One season and provided an unprecedented level of domination.  The car took seven victories during the season giving the drivers' championship to Andretti, and the constructors' championship to Lotus.

1984 McLarem MP4/2.  The McLaren MP4/2 was designed by John Barnard of McLaren for the 1984 season.

The car was one of the first to use an all carbon fibre chassis, following on from Lotus.  The car was powered by a TAG Porsche V6 Turbo engine, which was first used in the final few races of 1983, at the insistence of Niki Lauda, who felt that the new engine required race testing before a championship challenge could be mounted.  His instincts were right on.

The MP4/2 was one of the first F1 cars to use carbon brakes, giving it another major advantage over most of its rivals.  That, combined to superior fuel consumption and the driving skill of Lauda and Prost saw the MP4/2 score 12 wins in 1984, at the time the highest number of wins in a season by a single team.  Lauda beat Prost to the championship by a measly half point in the final race, even though Prost had 7 wins to Lauda's 5.

1987 Williams FW-011B.  The Williams FW11 was designed by Patrick Head and Frank Dernie as a serious challenger to McLaren and their MP4/2 car.  The car took over from where the FW10 left off at the end of 1985, when that car won the last three races of the season.  The FW11's most notable feature was the Honda 1.5 Litre V6 turbo engine, the most powerful in F1 at the time producing 800 bhp at 12,000rpm and well over 1,000 bhp in qualifying.  Added to the engine's power were the aerodynamics, which were ahead of the MP4/2 and the Lotus 97T.  That and its excellent driving pairing of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell made it a force to be reckoned with.  The car was an instantly recognisable product of the turbo era of F1.

In 1986, the car won first time out in Brazil with Piquet, before Mansell laid down a title challenge with four wins.  Williams were shaken by the near fatal road crash of Frank Williams which demoralised the team, but Head stepped up and managed the team until Williams returned late in the season.  This may have caused the in-fighting between the two team mates, and the lost points helped Alain Prost take his second world championship.  That and Mansell's spectacular blow out in the final race in Australia where all he had to do was finish third to win the title.  The points built up between Piquet and Mansell were enough for Williams to take the constructors' championship, however.

The FW11 was updated slightly for 1987 to become the FW11B, and the team made no mistakes in wrapping up both championships.  Honda were now supplying Lotus with the same engine supplied to Williams, which helped Ayrton Senna challenge consistently, but the FW11's superiority told, and Piquet was champion.  As for Mansell, he scored six victories including a memorable win at the British Grand Prix.  He scored twice as many wins as Piquet, but also had the lion's share of bad luck and unreliability.  Piquet's third championship was assured after Mansell had a major crash during practice for the Japanese Grand Prix.  The team tried active suspension for the first time with the FW11, and there were plans to introduce semi automatic transmission, but this never came to pass.

The FW11 was not a technical showcase by any means, but solid engineering, the engine's outright power and Piquet and Mansell helped the car take 18 wins, 16 pole positions and 278 points.

In the 1987 season, the car was driven by Michele Alboreto (number 27) and Gerhard Berger (number 28) and replaced the Ferrari F1/86 used in 1986.  Gustav Brunner designed the car with assistance from John Barnard.  The F1/87 featured a six speed gearbox and a turbo charged 1.5 litre V6 engine.  Gerhard Berger scored two victories in the F1/87 at the 1987 Japanese Grand Prix and 1987 Australian Grand Prix and three pole positions.  The car demonstrated flashes of its potential early in the season with Alboreto for a short time leading the San Marino Grand Prix.  However, reliability issues were a major concern.  From the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, Ferrari looked to have a car as quick as any of their rivals.  Berger challenged Mansell for the lead at the Hungarian Grand Prix before being forced to retire.  The Austrian also came within a whisker of winning the Portuguese Grand Prix before spinning and the Mexican Grand Prix which he was leading before reliability issues forced him out once again.  The season finished on a high with dominating victories for Berger in the final two rounds and Alboreto made it a Ferrari 1-2 in Adelaide after Senna's disqualification.  Ferrari went into 1988 as one of the favourites for the championship.

A single stamp featuring the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix.

The race was held at the Montjuic circuit (Barcelona) on 27th April 1975.  It is remembered as one of the most tragic race weekends after the death of 5 spectators (hit by the crashing Hill GH1 of Rolf Stommelen).  It was also the race in which Lella Lombardi became the first and so far only woman to score points in a championship race.

The race was won by Jochen Mass driving the McLaren M23 - the only win of his career.

A single stamp featuring the 2009 Renault R29.

The Renault R29 was a big disappointment - the car arguably became less competitive throughout the season.  Renault started the season as the ING Renault F1 team, but ING withdrew their sponsorship afte the 'crashgate' scandal.  The Renault F1 team ordered Nelson Piquet Jr to crash deliberately during the Singapore Grand Prix in order to gain advantage for his team mate, Fernando Alonso.

The car was unveiled in Maranello, Italy on 28 January 2010.

A single stamp featuring the 2010 McLaren Mercedes MP4/25.

The McLaren MP4-25, driven by 2009 World Champion Jenson Button and 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton, was officially unveiled at title sponsor Vodafone's headquarters in Newbury, Berkshire, United Kingdom on January 29, 2010.  McLaren were runner up in the constructors' championship in 2010.

The Red Bull Racing team complained to the FIA about the legality of the MP4-25's rear wing. The design uses a small "snorkel" air scoop mounted in front of the driver that channels air through a duct in the cockpit and towards the rear of the car. Changes in the pressure in the duct, in combination with small slots on the rear wing, causes the wing to enter a stalled state at high speed, reducing aerodynamic drag and allowing the car as much as an extra 6 mph (9.7 km/h) on straights. The effect is controlled by the driver covering up a small hole in the cockpit with his left leg - this is not considered by the FIA to be a moveable aerodynamic device, which would be banned under the technical regulations. Known internally as the RW80 it is widely called the "F-Duct" system either due to the shape of the air intake or the fact that it is beside the F of the Vodafone logo. Another term for the system is switchable rear wing (SRW). The car was inspected on the Thursday prior to the Bahrain Grand Prix (the season opener) and cleared to take part in the race.

A single stamp featuring the 2010 Mercedes MGP W01.

The Mercedes MGP W01 was designed and built by the Mercedes GP Petronas team for the 2010 season and was driven by the returning seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg. The car was revealed at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo near Valencia at the first official test of the year on February 1. The team's silver livery was officially unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart on January 25, 2010 on the chassis of a Brawn BGP 001 following Mercedes' purchase of the championship-winning team of 2009.

The team's achievements in their first season did not come close to those of Brawn the previous year, with the Mercedes battling Renault for the title of 'best of the rest' behind the leading three teams of Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull. Rosberg finished on the podium three times, at Sepang, Shanghai and Silverstone. Schumacher's best finishes were three fourth places. He did not score a race win, podium, pole position or fastest lap for the first time since his debut season in 1991, and also scored the worst finish of his F1 career at Valencia, where he finished fifteenth. Schumacher was penalised for dangerous driving after forcing his former Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello towards the pit wall at 180 mph (290 km/h). At the last race in Abu Dhabi Schumacher spun while trying to overtake Rosberg and was hit by Vitantonio Liuzzi's Force India.

The team finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship, with 214 points.

A single stamp featuring the Ferrari F150, Ferrari's 2011 challenger.

The '150' in the name was chosen to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification.  In early 2011, Ford gave its intentions to sue Ferrari over the F150 name (Ford owns the F150 trademark) - so Ferrari tweaked the name to "Ferrari 150 Italia".  The car itself lacked pace and was not able to mount a challenge to Red Bull Racing.

A single stamp showing the Chequered Flag.

The chequered flag is displayed at the start/finish line to indicate that the race is officially finished.

The origin of the flag is unknown, the most likely explanation is that the high contrast flag is most conspicuous against the background of a crowd, especially when races were run on dirt tracks.

A mini sheet of three stamps featuring the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.

The 1999 Canadian Grand Prix was held on June 13, 1999 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal.   Heinz-Harald Frentzen (in a Jordan) suffered a brake failure and had a massive crash with four laps to go.  Frentzen was unhurt, but his crash caused this contest to be the first ever F1 race to finish behind the safety car.  The safety car was deployed four times in the race, which was a record at the time.  It was first deployed for a collision at the start involving Jarno Trulli, Jean Alesi and Rubens Barrichello.  The safety car returned to the track again when Ricardo Zonta hit what is now famously known as the "Wall of Champions".  Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher also slammed into the same wall before Jacques Villeneuve crashed there bringing out the safety car a third time.  After former F1 world champions Michael Schumacher, Jacques Villeneuve, Damon Hill and reigning FIA GT champion Ricardo Zonta all crashed at the same (final) corner, the concrete wall on the outside of the chicane (turn 15) got its nickname "Wall of Champions".

The race was won by Mika Hakkinen (McLaren), with Giancarlo Fisichella (Benetton) second and Eddie Irvine (Ferrari) third.

<i>Issue date: 2000</i><br/><br/>
A sheet of 12 stamps showing a car from each of the 11 teams that took part in the 2000 F1 World championship.  They are (in order of constructors championship position): Ferrari (F1-2000), McLaren-Mercedes (MP4/15), Williams-BMW (FW22), Benetton-Playlife (B200), BAR-Honda (002), Jordan-Mugen-Honda (EJ10), Arrows-Supertec (A21), Sauber-Petronas (C19(, Jaguar-Cosworth (R1), Minardi-Fondmetal (M02) and Prost-Peugeot (AP03).

The season was marred by one death: a race marshal was killed at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The two Jordans collided on the approach to the Variante della Roggia chicane and slid into the cars ahead of them. The marshal was struck by a loose tyre from one of the Jordans. Michael Schumacher considered quitting the sport as this was the first death in F1 since driver Ayrton Senna's in 1994.

This season held the record for least number of drivers competing in a single season with only 1 driver change (Luciano Burti in Austria) putting the total at 23. This record stood until 2008, where there were no driver changes.
