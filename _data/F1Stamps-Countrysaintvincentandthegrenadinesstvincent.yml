    Description: |
      Between 1983 and 1987 the Islands of the British Commonwealth collaboratively produced an Omnibus issue of official postage stamps commemorating every important road and race car ever built (to mark the first 100 Years of the Automobile).  An outstanding group of automotive experts was assembled to recommend cars for the collection.  The collection became known as "The World's Greatest Car Collection" and AUTO 100 / The Leaders of the World Series.    These stamps are genuine and were recognised and used as valid postal currency for the transport of mail throughout the world. All these stamps have been officially catalogued by Scott, Michel, Yvert et Tellier, Unificato, Stanley Gibbons, and Domfil.  The stamps were on sale in Post Offices in the individual countries of origin for 90 days following issue, then withdrawn from sale. The stamps were also made available through the Crown / Commonwealth Agents until their full withdrawal in 1990.<br>

      The first stamp illustrates the technical / plan drawings and the second stamp depicts a print of the car.

    Description: |
      A single stamp commemorating Michael Schumacher's maiden Grand Prix win.<br>
      <br>
      The 1992 season (Schumacher's second season) was dominated by the two Williams cars, which had the powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension.  However, Schumacher in the "conventional" Benetton B192 secured his first ever podium finish, 3rd at the Mexican Grand Prix.  Schumacher then went on to take his maiden victory at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps (a circuit that by 2003 he was referring to as his favourite track).
