      A mini sheet with one stamp featuring Rubens Barrichello and Ferrari.<br>
      <br>
      Rubens Barrichello drove for Ferrari from 2000 to 2005.  His most successful year was 2002, when he won four races for the team and finished a career best second place in the drivers' championship, scoring 77 championship points.  The year was marked by controversy, however, when Ferrari team orders required Barrichello to allow the trailing Schumacher to pass him on the final straight of the Austrian Grand Prix to take victory.  Schumacher exchanged podium places with Barrichello at the podium ceremony and gave Barrichello the winner's trophy.  The drivers were fined for disrupting podium protocol and Ferrari's blatant team orders led to the FIA banning team orders beginning in 2003.
