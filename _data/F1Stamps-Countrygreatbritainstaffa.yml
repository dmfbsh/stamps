    Description: |
      The Lotus 18 was designed by Colin Chapman; it was the first mid-engined car built by Lotus.  It was introduced for the 1960 F1 season.<br>

      The car took Lotus' first F1 victory, by Innes Ireland in the non-championship Glover Trophy, on 8th April 1960.  Its first World Championship win happened six weeks later, on 29th May, albeit by privateer Rob Walker, who leased the car from Chapman.  Driven by Stirling Moss the car took a dominant win at the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix.  Moss also won the United States Grand Prix at the end of the season helping Lotus finish second in the constructors' championship.<br>

      Moss repeated his win in a legendary race at Monaco the following year, beating off the more powerful and faster 'sharknose' Ferraris.  He then won at the fearsome Nurburgring in changeable weather, while Innes Ireland took a third win in the USA to help Lotus finish second in the constructors' championship in 1961.  The Lotus 18 was also notable for giving Jim Clark his first Grand Prix start in 1960.
