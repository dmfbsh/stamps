      The race is also remembered for one of the fiercest battles ever for second place, between Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve and Renault driver Rene Arnoux, who on several occasions during the final laps touched wheels and swapped positions.  The fight is often cited as one of the most memorable pieces of racing in F1.  Villeneuve, who passed the finish line less than half a second ahead of Arnoux, later described the occasion as "my best memory of Grand Prix racing".
