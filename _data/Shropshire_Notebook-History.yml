  Date: Precambrian Eon
  Description: |
    The first of Shropshire's rocks are formed 700 to 555 million years ago, creating some of Shropshire's best known hills including the Wrekin, Caer Caradoc and the Long Mynd.  The rocks are part of the Vendian supercontinent (also know as Pannotia) and are located in the southern hemisphere, approximately 60 degrees south of the equator.

    Towards the end of the Precambrian eon the supercontinent of Vendian starts to split (divided by the Iapetus Ocean), the rocks that would become Shropshire are now part of the Gondwana continent.

    In the Cambrian period, Shropshire moves to 65 degrees south of the equator due to the widening of the Iapetus Ocean.

  Date: Ordovician Period
  Description: |
    At the start of the Ordovician period, Shropshire (along with the rest of Southern Britain) formed part of the north-east margin of Gondwana.  During this period, a rift formed on the margin of the continent, creating the micro continent of Avalonia, and this new continent included Shropshire.  Avalonia starts to move northwards (at a rate of circa 2.4cm per year) as a new ocean (the Rheic Ocean) forms between Avalonia and Gondwana.

  Date: Silurian Period
  Description: |
    The micro continent of Avalonia continued to move north during the Silurian period.  As it moved closer to the equator, the subtropial environment allowed coral reefs to grow on the northern margins of the continent, this resulted in the formation of the famous Much Wenlock limestone, circa 421 to 433 million years ago.

    Perhaps the most famous rock formation in England, the Much Wenlock Limestone is known for its abundance of fossils, many of which were first recorded either in Shropshire or Worcestershire, and are found no-where else in the world.

  Date: Mesolithic Age
  Description: |
    The Mesolithic Age (or middle Stone Age, circa 9,000 to 4,000 BC) is characterised by a warmer climate that changed the arctic environment to one of pine, birch and alder forest.  The improved climate led to the continuous human occupation of Britain.  The less open landscape was less conducive to the large herds of reindeer and wild horse that had previously sustained humans.  Those animals were replaced in people's diets by pig and less social animals such as elk, red deer, roe deer and wild boar, which would have required different hunting techniques.  Tools changed to incorporate barbs which could snag the flesh of an animal, making it harder for it to escape alive.  Farming was introduced to Britain at the end of Mesolithic Age around 4,500 BC, although hunter-gather ways of life continued it was being replaced by distinct territories occupied by different groups.

    By about 6500 BC, rising seas had inundated the land bridge with Europe, making Britain an island.

    In Shropshire flint scrapers and other implements from this age, and made out of local pebble flint, have been found primarily in the parishes of Worfield, Claverley and Alveley, along the South East border of the county.

    ## The Bronze Age

    Remains of Bronze Age settlements are not common in Britain and none have been recorded in Shropshire so far.  It is believed that many tribes led a nomadic lifestyle based on cattle and agriculture so did not build structures to last (communities were often based near rivers for transport).  There is evidence, however, of tree clearing at this time to make space for crops.

    Tumuli (burial mounds) were built during this time on areas of high ground.  As well as providing a place to inter the cremated remains of their dead, the tumuli may also be where a tribe gathered at certain times of the year for religious purposes.  There are three known stone circles in Shropshire that date from this time at: Mitchell's Fold, Hoarstones and Whetstones (now destroyed).

    ## The Iron Age

    c. 500 BC - Celts inhabit much of Europe, and begin to colonize the British Isles.

    The area now known as Shropshire was part of the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe (they also occupied the areas now known as Cheshire, Staffordshire north Herefordshire and parts of the eastern areas of Wales - areas now known Flintshire, Powys and Wrexham).

    The capital of the tribe was most probably the Wrekin hill fort.  The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD.  The origin of the name Cornovii is unknown, but it may mean 'People of the Horn' referring to a horned god cult followed by the tribe.

    The site was abandoned around 88 AD as a fortress and was taken over as a civilian settlement and continued to be inhabited until the 7th century.

    The ruin is noted for the 'the Old Work' (an archway, part of the baths' frigidarium and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in Britain).

    ## Post-Roman Britain

    In 407 the Roman troops in Britain are sent across the Channel into Gaul to defend that part of the Empire against the threats from the east. This left Britain without any protection, the Saxons took advantage and raided in 408 and 409 AD. Requests for aid were rejected by the Emperor in Rome, and so the Romano-Britains expelled the Roman officials.

    Roman civic life continued, but declined (as the cities had lost their central function as centres for taxation and administration) and by about 450 AD the Roman economic system had broken down. Many of the Roman buildings at Viroconium Cornoviorum fall into disrepair and there is a substantial rebuilding programme in timber - who instigated this rebuilding is unknown, possibly a bishop.

    ## Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain Begins

    England is subject to successive invasions of Germanic tribesmen (Angles, Saxons and Jutes). Originally settling in eastern England, they moved progressively west as more arrived.

    The Cornovian tribal area is under the rule of the Kingdom of Pengwern (little is known about Pengwern and how it came about, although according to Welsh tradition it was part of the Welsh kingdom of Powys). Early Powys, much larger in extent than the later medieval kingdom, is thought to have roughly coincided with the territory of the Cornovii tribe whose civitas capital or administrative centre was Viroconium Cornoviorum.

    It is possible that the area of Shrewsbury was first settled in the 5th Century by refugees from Wroxeter. Also, at this time the king of Powys may have moved his court to the same area to resist the encroaching Anglian advances.

    Wroxeter’s abandonment as a settlement cannot be precisely dated, however, but may have occurred in the mid sixth century, when a 'Great Plague' is known to have swept through Britain, or possibly in the seventh century, when the Anglo-Saxons took control of the region.

    The Battle of Maserfield (or Maserfeld, "marsh (border) field"), was fought on 5th August 641 or 642, between the Anglo-Saxon kings Oswald of Northumbria and Penda of Mercia, ending in Oswald’s defeat, death, and dismemberment.

    It is also thought that the Pengwern participated in the battle, as allies of Penda.

    The battle left Penda (the Mercian king) as the most powerful king in England.

    ## Integration with Mercia

    Evidence of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Shropshire is rare before the 7th Century.

    Following a period of military alliance with Mercian rulers, particularly King Penda, Pengwern was absorbed by neighbouring Mercia after 642 AD (and the battle of Maserfield). The local Cornovian people may have continued to reside in the area, perhaps as the Wrekensaete, under Mercian rule.

    It is likely that the Cornovii territory was partitioned and ruled by different princes, probably perpetuated in the ancient boundaries between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.

    Eventually, the northern part of Shropshire was part of the Anglo-Saxon territory of Wreocensaete (sometimes anglicised to Wrekinsets, the name approximates to Wrekin-dwellers) and the southern part of Shropshire probably belonged to the Magonsaete (a minor sub-kingdom of the greater Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia).

    The northern and southern parts of Shropshire were absorbed into the Saxon kingdom of Mercia by King Offa (Offa ruled Mercia from 757 to 796). In 765 AD he constructed Watt’s Dyke to defend his territory against the Welsh, and in 779 AD, having pushed across the River Severn, drove the Welsh King of Powys from Shrewsbury, he secured his conquests by a second defensive earthwork known as Offa’s Dyke.

    The name "Mercia" is Old English for "boundary folk".

    Shrewsbury was probably founded as a town in the 8th Century by the Saxon rulers of Mercia, who needed a fortified burh to control the Severn river-crossing on the road between the burhs of Hereford and Chester.

    ## Mercia converts to Christianity in the latter part of the 7th Century AD.

    The first kings of Mercia were pagans, and they resisted the encroachment of Christianity longer than other kingdoms in the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.

    Mercian rulers remained resolutely pagan until the reign of Peada in 656. The first appearance of Christianity in Mercia, however, had come at least thirty years earlier, following the Battle of Cirencester of 628, when Penda incorporated the formerly West Saxon territories of Hwicce into his kingdom, but Penda remained Pagan until his death.  Penda respected the Christians and even allowed them to operate more widely in Mercia.  However, not much progress was made in converting the nobles and people of Mercia.

    The diocese of Mercia was founded in 656 by Diuma (the first Bishop of Mercia).

    In 669 AD, the King of Mercia, Wulfhere, had requested a new bishop, as Mercia was without one following the death of the previous incumbent, Chad was dispatched by the Archbishop.  And so, after an inconclusive start, decisive steps to Christianise Mercia were being taken; Chad was the fifth bishop to minister to the Mercians and is credited with introducing Christianity to the Mercian kingdom.  Wulfhere gave Chad land to build a monasterary at Lichfield.

    However, Mercia did not survive long as an ecclesiastical entity.  From 676 AD the Archbishop adopted a policy of appointing bishops to much smaller tribal groups within the kingdoms, thus covering smaller areas—closer in size to those found in other West European countries.  Hence, a bishopric (diocese) was established at Hereford (in 676 AD - one of the oldest in England) for the Magonsæte sub-kingdom (and the existing Lichfield diocese covered Wreocansaete).

    He was at once venerated as a saint and his Shrine in the Cathedral of Lichfield was a place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages.

    The Vikings had been raiding Britain since 792 AD, but being so far west, this had little impact on Shropshire until Danelaw was established.

    Danelaw is established in 878 AD which divides Britain into the Anglo-Saxon south and the Danish north.

    Although not part of the Danelaw, the area that is now known as Shropshire was regularly overrun by Danish raiders in the 9th and 10th Centuries, as the eastern part of Mercia had been seized by the Danes. In 874 the Danes destroyed the famous priory of Wenlock.

    ## The end of Mercia

    The final Mercian king died in 879 AD.  From about 883 to 911 AD Mercia was ruled by a Mercian Lord under the overlorship of Wessex.  Thus, the Kingdom of Mercia appears to have lost its political independence and was ruled by the kings of Wessex.  The last reference to Mercia by name is in the annal for 1017 AD, when Eadric Streona was awarded the government of Mercia by Cnut.  The Mercians as a people are last mentioned in the annal for 1049 AD.

    Mercia was mapped out into shires in the 10th century after its recovery from the Danes by Edward the Elder (King of the Anglo-Saxons).

    The first mention of "Shropshire" in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle occurs under 1006 - this is when the King crossed the Thames and wintered in the area of Shropshire.

    Thirteen years before the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that in 1053 the Welshmen slew a great many of the English wardens at Westbury, and in that year the English king ordered that any Welshman found beyond Offa's Dyke within the English shire should have his right hand cut off.

    In the Domesday Survey, Earl Godwin, Sweyn, Harold, Queen Edith, Edward the Confessor and Edwin and Morcar (these are earls, kings and queens from Wessex and Mercia) are mentioned as having held lands in the county shortly before or during the Norman Conquest.

    The castle is believed to have been founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England.

    During the 12th and 13th Centuries the castle changed hands many times.  The Duke of York inherited the castle in 1425 and it was a symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses.  Then in 1461 ownership passed to the crown.

    The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales.  Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.

    With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.

    No town was recorded until 1272, although the Welsh were referring to Croes Oswald in 1254.

    The castle was fought over and changed ownership many times during the conflict between the English and the Welsh.  By 1270 the castle's walls had been extended to encircle the town, but by this time the castle's military significance was in decline.

    The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398.

    The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1644, and by 1650 it had largely been demolished by the Roundheads.

    During the English Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands' main Royalist strongholds.  But following a three week siege Cromwell's Roundheads took Bridgnorth - Cromwell ordered that the castle be demolished and by 1647 little of the structure remained.  As a result, the remaining parts of the great tower now lean at an angle of 15 degrees (four times the lean of the tower at Pisa).

  Date: 19th September 1138 AD
  Description: |
    Born probably between 610 and 620, Winefride resolved to dedicate her life to God by living a life of chastity and prayer.  Winefride was martyred as a teenager.  After her martyrdom, Winefride continued to live a holy life first as a hermit and then as a nun at Gwytherin, a remote place in Denbighshire.

    In Shrewsbury, the abbey church was ready for consecration by 1130 but did not have any holy relics and the monks were envious of the many said to be in Wales.  The monks of Shrewsbury began negotiations to obtain the relics of St Winefride for their abbey.  With the consent of the Bishop of Bangor Herebert, the Abbot of Shrewsbury dispatched Prior Robert and another monk called Richard to Wales to obtain St Winefride's relics.  The relics of St Winefride were finally translated to the Abbey on 19th September 1138.  The shrine of Saint Winefride in Shrewsbury Abbey became a popular place of pilgrimage.  The shrine of Saint Winefride at Shrewsbury was destroyed in the reformation.  A fragment possibly of the shrine or of a reredos was recorded by the Rev. Blakeway in the early nineteenth century.

  Date: 1145-1148 AD
  Description: |
    The Abbey was founded around 1148 AD for a community of what is thought to be about 13 Augustinian canons from Dorchester Abbey in Oxfordshire.

    During the 13th Century, the Abbey enjoyed great wealth and prestige - a respectable income was derived from a variety of sources, including even the tolls for the use of the Atcham Bridge.  The then king (Henry III) was entertained at the Abbey twice in about 1240 AD.

    The Abbey suffered financial problems in the 14th Century (the abbott was accused of mismanagement).

    The Abbey was closed in 1538, as part of the Suppression of the Monasteries.  The site then became a private dwelling until the mid-17th Century.

    During the Civil War, the former Abbey buildings were severely damaged by Parliamentarian troops, at which point the site was abandoned and left to decay.

  Description: |
    Malinslee Chapel was a Norman chapel originally erected within the grounds of Malinslee Hall. The chapel was a small sandstone structure approximately 15 metres long, consisting of chancel and nave divided by a stone screen. Today, the remains of the chapel are located in the Telford Town Park.

    The chapel had become a ruin by the 18th Century, probably before 1786, when Rev Williams produced a painting of the ruins. In 1909, the ruin was bought by Edward Parry, vicar of Malinslee, who proposed to restore it as a place of worship to designs by W. A. Webb, but nothing came of this. When Malinslee Hall was demolished in 1971 to make way for the new Telford Town Centre, the chapel was dismantled by the Telford Development Corporation and later re-assembled in the nearby Telford Town Park.

  Name: Alberbury Castle
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The origins of the castle are uncertain but it was probably built in the 13th century by Fulk FitzWarin (a prominent representative of a marcher family associated especially with estates in Shropshire) during the reign of Richard I.

    The main purpose of its construction appears to have been as a barrier to stop the Welsh onslaught and to retain control of the passes along the river Severn.

    It is thought that the castle was razed by Llewellyn the Great in 1223, only to be rebuilt three years later in 1226, this time with a stone wall surrounding the bailey. A few years later the Sheriff of Shropshire ejected Fulk FitzWarin from the castle and took over his lands citing FitzWarin's utterances he made as a renunciation of fealty. However, Fitzwarin was able to retake his lands and his manor through the law. The FitzWarin family retained possession of the castle, although they moved their seat of power to Whittington after they secured it as a stronghold, until the mid fourteenth century, when it may have been abandoned.

  Name: Ashfield Hall, Much Wenlock
  Date: 13th Century

    Ashfield Hall is an historic house, consisting of two distinct portions. The left-hand side is the original 15th Century structure of coursed stone rubble with stone dressings, and the right-hand of timber frame and plaster was added late in the 16th Century.

    The site was originally the site of St John's hospital, founded in the 13th Century for 'lost and naked beggars'.  The building was occupied in the 15th Century as the private house of the Ashfield family.  Later it was called the Blue Bridge Inn from the bridge over a stream that ran in front.  Charles I is believed to have stayed here in 1642 on his way from Shrewsbury to Oxford.

  Name: Hopton Castle
  Date: 1260s AD
  Description: |
    It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle.  The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.

    It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s.  The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.

    The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.

A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.

    In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons.  The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.

  Name: Stokesay Castle
  Date: 1280s AD
  Description: |
    One of the first fortified manor houses in England, Stokesay Castle was built by Laurence of Ludlow.  It was built on the site of an earlier castle, some of which still survives.  Laurence of Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England.

    The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War.  At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king.  The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender.  The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.

  Name: Lavington's Hole, Bridgnorth
  Date: 1646 AD
  Description: |
    On 31st March 1646 during the Civil War, Bridgnorth was under siege from Parliamentary forces - the Royalists retreated to the castle after setting fire to the stables in Listley Street.  The fire soon spread to burn down many buildings in High Town.  It was the incendiary torches fired from the castle that ignited St. Leonards Church, burning all the town records that were stored in the church.  By 1st April 1646 most of Bridgnorth High Town was destroyed by the great fire.

    After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington took charge of getting a team of Parliamentary forces to dig a 70 foot tunnel under Castle Hill.  Knowing that the Royalists stored their gunpowder in St Marys Church, his aim was to blow up the church.

    69 feet of tunnel was dug into the rock face but was not completed as the Royalists surrendered on Sunday 26th April 1646.

Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War, serving on and later commanding several vessels. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against pirates and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession.

    Benbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral.  He was then involved in an incident during the action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture, including Treasure Island - the Admiral Benbow is the tavern where Jim Hawkins and his mother live.

  Date: 1809 AD
  Description: |
    William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

    Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.

    Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.
