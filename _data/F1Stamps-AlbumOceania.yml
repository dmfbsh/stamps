        A souvenir sheet featuring the 10th anniversary of the Foster's Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, Melbourne.<br>
        <br>
        The Australian Grand Prix was originally held at Adelaide, a street circuit considered to be one of greatest in the world.  The race was held there from 1985 to 1995.  From 1996 the race ws moved to Melbourne, this was a controversial move and a series of protests were organised by the "Save Albert Park" group, as it meant turning a public park into a private playground for one week each year.  Approximately 401,000 people turned out for the first race at Albert Park.<br>
        <br>
        The Adelaide races were always the final race of each season; whereas the Albert Park races tend to be season openers, and so have seen many debuts.

        These stamps celebrate some of the great cars, drivers and events of Australian motor racing history. Including,  Sir Jack Brabham, shown racing his Australian-engineered Repco-Brabham at Sandown Park in 1966. This car took Sir Jack to victory at the World Formula One Drivers' Championship and the World Formula One Constructors' Championship that same year. And in 1980, Alan Jones (Williams FW07 Ford) won both the Australian Grand Prix at Calder and the World Formula One Drivers' Championship. Australian Mark Weber was official reserve and test driver for the Renault-owned Benetton team in 2001. In his fifth year of international racing, Weber won three F3000 races as lead driver for Super Nova Racing and went on to claim second place in the 2001 F3000 International Championship.

        A set of stamps featuring various champions of motorsport.  The set features Denis Hulme and Bruce McLaren.<br>
        <br>
        Denis Hulme raced in F1 from 1965 to 1974, he drove for Brabham for the first three years and then for McLaren for the rest of his time in F1.  The 1967 Championship was essentially an internal affair within the Brabham team for most of the year, but the new Lotus 49 gave Jim Clark and Graham Hill the opportunity to bite back.  But two wins in the 11-race Championship, at Monte Carlo and the ferocious Nurburgring (the Green Hell), and a series of strong points finishes, gave Hulme the advantage.  He won the Championship by five points from Jack Brabham, and a further five from Jim Clark.  Hulme was the first (and to date, only) F1 World Champion from New Zealand.  In 1968 Hulme joined fellow Kiwi Bruce McLaren at his team; Hulme won a few races over the years at McLaren and managed third in the drivers championship in 1968 and 1972.<br>
        <br>
        Bruce McLaren raced in F1 from 1958 to 1970; he drove for Cooper before establishing his own team in 1966.  His career best was a second and third in the drivers championship with Cooper and a third in the drivers championship with his own team.  McLaren was a competitive driver but in many ways his legacy, the McLaren Racing Team, is testimony to his abilities as an analyst, engineer and manger that contributed much to the success of the cars that bore his name.  Bruce McLaren died (aged 32) when his Can-Am car crashed on the Lavant Straight just before Woodcote corner at the Goodwood Circuit on 2nd June 1970.
