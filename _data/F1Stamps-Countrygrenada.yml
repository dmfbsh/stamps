      The McLaren MP4/2 was a F1 car designed by John Barnard of McLaren for the 1984 season.<br>
      <br>
      The MP4/2 was one of the few F1 cars to use carbon brakes at the time, giving it another major advantage over most of its rivals on all bar street circuits or when conditions were hot and dry; notably, the carbon brakes weren't as good as the steel brakes at tracks like the Detroit and Dallas street circuits due to the steel brakes lasting longer in the heat.  That, combined to superior fuel consumption of the allowed 220 litres and the driving skill of Lauda and Prost saw the MP4/2 score 12 wins in 1984, at the time the highest number of wins in a season by a single team.
