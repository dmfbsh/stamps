        <br>
        The 126 C4 was the last in a series of cars used from 1981 to 1984 - the 126 was Ferrari's first attempt at a turbo engined F1 car.

        <br>
        The 156 was made by Ferrari in 1961 to comply with the then-new F1 regulations that lowered engine displacement from 2.5 to 1.5 litres.  The 1961 version was affectionately dubbed 'sharknose' due to its characteristic air intake 'nostrils'.  Then-Ferrari factory policy inevitably saw all the remaining sharknose 156s scrapped by the end of the 1963 season.

        <br>
        The 246 F1 was built for the 1958 F1 season.  The regulations for 1954 to 1960 limited naturally aspirated engines to 2500cc and for the 1958 season there was a change from alcohol fuels to AvGas.  The 246 F1 was good enough to allow Mike Hawthorn to win the world championship.  The Ferrari 246 was the first V6 engined car to compete in F1; it was also the last front engined car to win an F1 grand prix (1960 Italian grand prix).

        <br>
        The 312T2 was the second iteration of the 312T series of cars which was used from 1975 to 1980.  The car was powered by the powerful and ultra-reliable flat-12 engine which gave about 510 bhp, the 'T' in the name stood for transverse, as the gearbox was mounted in this way, improving the car's handling characteristics.

        The 312T3 was the third iteration of the 312T series of cars which was used from 1975 to 1980.  The car was powered by the powerful and ultra-reliable flat-12 engine which gave about 510 bhp, the 'T' in the name stood for transverse, as the gearbox was mounted in this way, improving the car's handling characteristics.  In the T3, the chassis was completely new, with a monocoque structure and a different suspension arrangement, designed to work with the Michelin tyres.  The bodywork had a flatter top to the body, allowing improved air flow to the rear wing.

        <br>
        The 312 was used from 1966 to 1969; for the 1966 F1 season, there was a change in the technical regulations, now allowing 3 litre engines.  The F1 teams, even though asking for "the return to power", were more or less surprised and not well prepared.  The designation 312, which would be used for a number of later cars, indicated a 3 litre, 12 cylinder engine.

        <br>
        For the 1954 season and the return to Formula 1 engine regulations, Ferrari 500 chassis were modified for the new regulations with the 2.5-litre 625 engine and would win two more races, one each in 1954 and 1955, although it was not quite fast enough compared to the Mercedes-Benz W196 and Maserati 250F.  Despite two new models appearing during this period the 625 was not completely replaced until 1956 when Ferrari began using the D50 chassis Ferrari purchased along with the Lancia Formula One team.

        <br>
        The 640 was used for the 1989 F1 season, the car was fast but very unreliable.  It was powered by Ferrari's own 3.5 litre V12 engine - the team's first naturally aspirated engine for almost a decade.  The car also contained the very first 7-speed semi-automatic gearbox seen in F1 and it was this that caused most of the retirements.  Despite the unreliable gearbox, Ferrari finished 3rd in the constructors' championship.

        Ferrari's major coup was signing reigning champion Alain Prost from McLaren for the 1990 season to partner Nigel Mansell.  As such, the 641 was designed with Prost's smooth driving style in mind.  The car was seen to be technically advanced as it included the semi-automatic gearbox developed in the previous season.

        Originally the Lancia D50, this car made use of many innovative features, such as the use of the engine as a stressed chassis member, the off-centre positioning of the engine to allow a lower overall height, and pannier fuel cells for better weight distribution and aerodynamics.

        The F2003-GA was driven by Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello - Ferrari took both championships with this car (Schumacher being the drivers champion).  The car was designated 'GA' as a mark of respect to Gianni Agnelli, the recently deceased head of Fiat.

        Hill competed in Formula 1 from 1992 to 1999.  He drove for Brabham, Williams, Arrows and Jordan.  In 1996 he won the World Championship - the only son of a World Champion to do so.  Hill also gave Jordan their first win in 1998.<br>
        <br>
        In 2006, Hill became president of the British Racing Drivers' Club, succeeding Jackie Stewart - he presided over the securing of a 17-year contract for Silverstone to hold the British Grand Prix, which enabled the circuit to undertake extensive renovation work.

        <br>
        Fangio competed in F1 from 1950 to 1958 - he won the drivers' championship five times, with four different teams (Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari and Maserati) - a feat that has never been repeated.  Regarded by many as the greatest driver of all time, Fangio was held in high regard by the drivers.  In his final race, Mike Hawthorn had lapped Fangio, but just before Hawthorn crossed the line, he braked to allow Fangio through so that he could complete the full race distance.

        Raikkonen competed in F1 from 2001 to 2009; during this time he drove for Sauber, McLaren and Ferrari.  He won the World Championship drivers' title with Ferrari in 2007.  In 2007, when he joined Ferrari, Raikkonen became the highest paid driver in motorsport.  In 2009, he was listed by Forbes as the second highest paid athlete in the world.<br>
        <br>
        Raikkonen was unable to secure a drive for 2010 - despite having a contract with Ferrari, he was replaced by Fernando Alonso.  Raikkonen returned to F1 in 2012 with the Lotus team.

        <br>
        Hakkinen competed in F1 from 1991 to 2001; for the first two years he drove for Lotus and then exclusively for McLaren for the rest of his F1 career.  Hakkinen was critically injured during qualifying at the final round of the 1995 season (Australia) - his life was saved by emergency surgery performed by Sid Watkins.  It was a tyre failure that caused the accident; the incident forged a strong bond between Hakkinen and team principal Ron Dennis.<br>
        <br>
        Hakkinen recovered and was on the starting grid for the first race of the 1996 season.  He went on become a double World Champion in 1998 and 1999.

        A postal stationery card featuring Sir Frank Williams CBE.<br>
        <br>
        Williams started out as driver and mechanic, this was funded by his work as a travelling grocery salesman.  He founded Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966, and ran a number of drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3; Williams purchased a Formula 1 Brabham chassis, which he entered in the 1969 season (driven by Piers Courage).  In 1972, Williams built his first F1 car, but it was crashed and destroyed at its first race.  In the early 1970's Williams struggled financially, but managed to keep going - in 1976 Williams finally took on a partner, Walter Wolf.  The team no longer belonged to Williams, so in 1977 he left, along with engineer Patrick Head.<br>
        <br>
        The two acquired an empty carpet warehouse in Didcot and formed Williams Grand Prix Engineering.  The team's first win came in 1979 when Clay Regazzoni drove the Cosworth powered Williams FW07 to victory at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

        <br>
        Moss competed in Formula 1 from 1951 to 1961 - he is regarded as one of the greats despite never winning the World Championship.  He was runner up four times and third place three times.  Moss drove a variety of cars for a number of teams, the cars were: HWM 51, HWM 52, ERA G Type, Connaught Type A, Cooper Special, Maserati 250F, Mercedes W196, Vanwall 57, Cooper T43, Cooper T51, BRM P25, Lotus 18 and Lotus 21.<br>
        <br>
        After a serious accident in 1962, Moss retired from F1.  He remained the most successful English driver until 1991 when Nigel Mansell surpoassed Moss's number of wins.

        Alonso (Renault) went on to win the race anyway, with Juan Pablo Montoya (McLaren) second and David Coulthard (Red Bull) third.

        Peter Collins competed in F1 from 1952 to 1958 - he drove for HW Motors (HWM 52 and 53), G A Vandervell (Vanwall Special), Maserati (250F) and Ferrari (555, D50, 801, Dino 246).  In 1956 he came third in the drivers' championship.  Collins was killed as a result of injuries sustained in an accident at the 1958 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring.  Whilst with Ferrari, Collins became close friends with team mate Mike Hawthorn, to the point that they agreed to split their winnings and engaged an intense rivalry with fellow Ferrari driver Luigi Musso.

        Mike Hailwood was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer regarded by many as one of the greatest racers of all time.  He became one of the few men to compete at Grand Prix level in both motorcycle and car racing.<br>
        <br>
        In F1, Hailwood drove for Reg Parnell Racing in 1963, 1964 and 1965 without much success.  In 1971, 1972 and 1973 he drove for Team Surtees, again more often than not retiring from races.  However, in 1972 he achieved his best result in F1 coming second at the Italian Grand Prix.  In his final season of F1, 1974, he drove for McLaren, and finished 11th in the Drivers' Championship.  He left Formula One after being injured badly at the 1974 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, so did complete the season with McLaren.<br>
        <br>
        Hailwood was recognised for his bravery when in the 1973 South African Grand Prix he went to pull Clay Regazzoni from his burning car after the two collided on the second lap of the race.  Hailwood's driving suit caught fire, but after being extinguished by a fire marshall he returned to help rescue Regazzoni, an act for which he was awarded the George Medal, the 2nd highest gallantry award that a British civilian can be awarded.

        Nigel Mansell will forever be associated with "Red 5" - teams in motor racing series are generally allocated numbers - when Mansell joined Williams in 1985 he was allocated number 5.  For the first four races of the 1985 season, both Williams cars had white numbers, but from a distance the numerals "5" and "6" resembled each other.  As a consequence, it was decided to give Mansell's car a red number to make it more distinctive.<br>
        <br>
        While this was initially just for recognition, BBC F1 commentator Murray Walker began describing Mansell's car as "Red Five", leading to Mansell retaining the red coloured number throughout his first spell at Williams.  On his return to the team in 1991, Williams had retained the number 5 car, allowing Mansell to race as "Red Five" once again.
