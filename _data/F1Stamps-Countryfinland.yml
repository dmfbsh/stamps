      Finland's postal service celebrates the success of the country's reigning Formula One world champion, Kimi Raikkonen, with a special sheet of stamps. The stamps, released as part of a series to help mark the Finnish postal service's 370th birthday, include images of Raikkonen on track for Ferrari and on the podium celebrating victory at the 2008 Malaysian Grand Prix.
