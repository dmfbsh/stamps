      <br>
      Created by the Prince Louis II under the impetus given by Antony Noghes, the "Grand- Prix of Monaco" is now a world-famous event, particularly appreciated by the drivers. After an interruption due to the wars, the 62nd Formula 1 Grand Prix will be held from 20th till 23rd May 2004.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most eventful races of the 2004 season, the Monaco Grand Prix saw Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher qualify in fourth place (his time was actually fifth best; his brother Ralf qualified second, but was dropped ten places as a penalty for changing engines). Renault driver Jarno Trulli took his first pole position and made it his first race win, breaking the elder Schumacher's streak of race wins; Jenson Button (BAR Honda) was second and Rubens Barrichello (Ferrari) third.

      The Automobile Club de Monaco is a motoring club based in Monaco.  The club serves as the governing body for motorsport within Monaco, and organises the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and Monte Carlo Rally.  It is a member of the FIA, representing Monaco as a mobility and sporting club.<br>
      <br>
      The Club was founded in 1890 as an association of cyclists, and began to incorporate motorists in 1907.  Antony Noghes, the son of the Club's president, organised the inaugural Monaco Grand Prix in 1929 on a circuit around the streets of Monaco, which caused the ACM to be admitted to the AIACR (the forerunner of the FIA) after it had previously been refused entry.<br>
      <br>
      In 2015, World Champion Lewis Hamilton secured his first ever Monaco pole position during Saturday's qualifying.  In the race, Nico Rosberg took his third consecutive win at Monaco, second win of the season, and the tenth of his career, while Sebastian Vettel finished second.  Championship leader Hamilton, who had led for most of the race, moved from first into third place following a "pit stop misjudgement" during a late safety car period, for which his team, Mercedes, later apologised.  The renewed McLaren-Honda partnership scored its first points since Honda's return to the sport.

      The Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus was founded in Paris on 20 June 1904, as an association of national motor clubs.

      <br>
      Upon the resumption of motor racing after the Second World War, the AIACR was renamed as the Ferderation Internationale de l'Automobile.

      A single stamp featuring James Hunt and McLaren.  Hunt drove for McLaren in the 1976, 1977 and 1978 seasons, driving the McLaren M23 and M26.  The 1976 season proved to be one of the most dramatic and controversial on record.  While Hunt's performances in the preceding three seasons at Hesketh had drawn considerable praise, there was some conjecture as to whether he could really sustain a championship challenge.  In 1976 he became a works McLaren driver, and quickly dispelled many doubters at the first race in Brazil, where, in a hastily rebuilt McLaren M23, he landed pole position in the last minutes of qualifying.  Following a dramatic season, Hunt took the drivers' title in 1976.

      A single stamp featuring the Renault RS01.<br>
      <br>
      The Renault RS01 was the first F1 car to be powered by a turbocharged engine, it was also the first to use radial tyres, which were provided by Michelin.  The rules of F1 at the time permitted 3.0 litre engines of natural aspiration, with a clause for a 1.5 litre supercharged or turbocharged engine.  All of the teams kept initially to the 3.0 litre specification (retaining the Ford Coswrth DFV engines, or continuing to develop in-house flat 12 engines).<br>
      <br>
      The car was used from 1977 to 1979, first appearing at the 10th round of the 1977 season at Silverstone.  The car proved to be very unreliable, it was cumbersome and overweight - in reality it was little more than an experimental test car.  The car was nicknamed ' the yellow teapot' by rival teams.  Out of 26 starts, it retired 19 times, and only once scored points.
