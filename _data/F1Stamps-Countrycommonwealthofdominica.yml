      A commemorative sheet featuring the Ferrari 126 C3.<br>
      <br>
      The Ferrari 126 C was Ferrari's first attempt at a turbo engine Formula 1 car - it was used in 1981.  The C3 was an evolution of that car for 1983.  In that year, mandatory flat bottoms for the cars were introduced, to reduce the ground effect.  To compensate for the lost downforce, the car was designed with an oversized rear wing.  The power from the engine was also boosted - this car probably had the most powerful engine on the grid in 1983.<br>
      <br>
      Ferrari won the constructors' championship with this car, their drivers were both in contention for the drivers' championship, but reliability issues meant that they lost out.
