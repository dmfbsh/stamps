      A set of stamps featuring various champions of motorsport.  The set features Denis Hulme and Bruce McLaren.<br>
      <br>
      Denis Hulme raced in F1 from 1965 to 1974, he drove for Brabham for the first three years and then for McLaren for the rest of his time in F1.  The 1967 Championship was essentially an internal affair within the Brabham team for most of the year, but the new Lotus 49 gave Jim Clark and Graham Hill the opportunity to bite back.  But two wins in the 11-race Championship, at Monte Carlo and the ferocious Nurburgring (the Green Hell), and a series of strong points finishes, gave Hulme the advantage.  He won the Championship by five points from Jack Brabham, and a further five from Jim Clark.  Hulme was the first (and to date, only) F1 World Champion from New Zealand.  In 1968 Hulme joined fellow Kiwi Bruce McLaren at his team; Hulme won a few races over the years at McLaren and managed third in the drivers championship in 1968 and 1972.<br>

      Bruce McLaren raced in F1 from 1958 to 1970; he drove for Cooper before establishing his own team in 1966.  His career best was a second and third in the drivers championship with Cooper and a third in the drivers championship with his own team.  McLaren was a competitive driver but in many ways his legacy, the McLaren Racing Team, is testimony to his abilities as an analyst, engineer and manger that contributed much to the success of the cars that bore his name.  Bruce McLaren died (aged 32) when his Can-Am car crashed on the Lavant Straight just before Woodcote corner at the Goodwood Circuit on 2nd June 1970.
