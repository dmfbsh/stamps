      The Bahrain International Circuit at Sakhir was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke.  Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However, organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive on the sand around the track.  The surface of the track is made of Graywacke aggregate, shipped to Bahrain from the Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire.  The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula 1 drivers for the high level of grip it offers. The same aggregate material is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

      The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on April 4, 2004, making history as the first F1 Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Bahrain fought off competition from elsewhere in the region to stage the race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates all hoping for the prestige of hosting a F1 Grand Prix.<br>

      The 2014 race was held as a night race under floodlights. It became the second F1 night race after the Singapore Grand Prix, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Grand Prix. It was won by Lewis Hamilton.
