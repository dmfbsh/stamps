      A mini sheet featuring Ayrton Senna and the McLaren MP4/5B - in 1990 Senna drove this car to his second World Championship.  At the penultimate round of the championship in Japan, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost - with nine points separating the two drivers.  Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack.  After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left.  In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna.  At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner.  While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 170 mph and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.
