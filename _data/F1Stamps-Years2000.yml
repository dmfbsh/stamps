  Description: |
    The FIA introduced some significant rule changes, with a focus on increased reliability.  Engines were required to last two Grand Prix without being changed.  The most significant change was that tyre changes during the course of the race were prohibited.<br>
    <br>
    Ferrari, one of the few teams using the Bridgestone tyres, could not find the right balance between performance and reliability and so lacked pace.<br>
    <br>
    Ferrari did win one race however, the United States Grand Prix, but this was because only the cars using Bridgestone tyres actually took part.  Michelin declared their tyres unsafe to run on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's banked corner, and so the majority of the grid simply drove into the pits after the parade lap.
