        In the 1961 Formula One season, the team kept Phil Hill, Wolfgang von Trips and Richie Ginther, and debuted another Carlo Chiti designed car, the Ferrari 156 based on the Formula 2 car of 1960, which was dominant throughout the season. Ferrari drivers Hill and von Trips competed for the championship. Giancarlo Baghetti joined in midseason and became the first driver to win on his debut race (the 1961 French Grand Prix). However, at the end of the season, von Trips crashed at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix and was killed, together with over a dozen spectators. Hill won the championship.<br>
        <br>
        In 2000 Schumacher had a close battle with rival Mika Hakkinen of McLaren but won the championship in the Ferrari F1-2000, winning 9 races out of 17 that year. He was Ferrari's first World Driver's Champion in 21 years, since Jody Scheckter in 1979. Team mate Rubens Barrichello finished fourth in the championship, taking his maiden win at the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheim after Schumacher was taken out in the first corner and Barrichello qualified 18th.

        <br>
        The 1975 F1 season started slowly for Lauda, but after nothing better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races he then won four out of the next five races in the new Ferrari 312T.  His first World Championship was confirmed with a fifth win at the last race of the year, the United States GP.  He also became the first and only driver to lap the Nurburgring Nordschleife in under 7 minutes, which was considered a huge feat.  And the Nordschleife section of the Nurburgring was 2 miles longer than it is today.

        <br>
        Lauda's previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his decision to withdraw from the previous season's Japanese Grand Prix (which effectively gave James Hunt the title), and he endured a difficult 1977 season, despite easily winning the championship through consistency rather than outright pace.  Having announced his decision to quit Ferrari at season's end, Lauda left early due to the team's decision to run the then unknown Gilles Villeneuve in a third car at the Canadian Grand Prix.

        A 4 stamp sheet featuring Lewis Hamilton (and a BMW F1 Car!).<br>
        <br>
        It was announced prior to the start of the 2007 season that Lewis Hamilton would be partnering double World Champion Fernando Alonso.  On his debut at the Australian Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fourth and finished third in the race, becoming the thirteenth driver to finish on the podium in his first F1 career race.  In Bahrain, Hamilton got his first front-row start, qualifying and finishing second behind Felipe Massa.  Hamilton again finished second behind Massa in the Spanish Grand Prix, to take the lead in the drivers championship.  This meant that Hamilton broke Bruce McLaren's record of being the youngest driver to ever lead the world championship.<br>
        <br>
        Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco and afterwards suggested he was prevented from racing his team mate.  The FIA cleared McLaren following an investigation.  Hamilton had both his first pole position and first victory of his F1 career in the Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal.  He led for most of the race even after the safety car was deployed four times increasing the chances of him being overtaken.  A week later Hamilton won the United States Grand Prix, also from pole position, becoming the first Briton since John Watson in 1983 to win an F1 race in the US, and only the second person, after Jacques Villeneuve, to win more than one race in his rookie F1 season since the first year of the Championship.<br>
        <br>
        Following further race wins at the Hungarian and Japanese Grand Prix, Hamilton came second to the drivers championship to Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) by 1 point.  Hamilton had the same number of points as Alsono (109), but was classified ahead of Alonso.  McLaren would have won the constructors title, but were stripped of all of their points due to the espionage scandal between them and Ferrari.<br>
        <br>
        Ahead of the world championship finale in Brazil, Hamilton answered a question about what it would mean to him to become the first black champion, saying: "It will show that not only white people can do it, but also black people, Indians, Japanese and Chinese. It will be good to mean something."  Having made few public remarks about his ethnicity since becoming an F1 driver, Hamilton added: "Outside of Formula One my heroes are foremost my father, then Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King.  Being black is not a negative.  It's a positive, if anything, because I'm different.  In the future it can open doors to different cultures and that is what motor sport is trying to do anyway".

There were minimal design changes from the previous season's car, Lewis Hamilton declared that 'it is difficult to pick up any differences'.

        A mini sheet featuring Ayrton Senna and the McLaren MP4/5B - in 1990 Senna drove this car to his second World Championship.  At the penultimate round of the championship in Japan, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost - with nine points separating the two drivers.  Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack.  After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left.  In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna.  At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner.  While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 170 mph and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.

        Senna was born on 21st March 1960, the three-time F1 world champion was fatally injured in a crash while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, he was pronounced dead at a hospital in Bologna, Italy, and remains the last Grand Prix driver to die at the wheel of an F1 car.<br>
        <br>
        After Senna's death, three days of national mourning were declared in Brazil, and he was accorded a state funeral in his hometown of Sao Paulo.  The largest funeral in Brazilian history, it was attended by an estimated one million people lining the route of the funeral cortege.

        1997 was Schumacher's second year with Ferrari.  Going in to the final race of the 1997 season Schumacher had a 1 point advantage over Jacques Villeneuve (Williams); during the race Schumacher was ahead of Villeneuve, but developed a coolant leak, when Villeneuve attempted to pass the ailing Ferrari, Schumacher tried to provoke an accident taking himself out of the race and handing Villeneuve the drivers' championship.  Schumacher was disqualified from the 1997 championship.

It is also the last McLaren car to be fitted with a Honda engine as it was replaced by Renault engines from the 2018 season onwards.

        <br>
        Senna is regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of F1.  In 2009, a poll of 217 current and former F1 drivers conducted by the British magazine Autosport named Senna as the greatest F1 driver.  He was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap and from 1989 until 2006 held the record for most pole positions.  He was especially quick in wet conditions, as shown by his performances in the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix.  He also holds the record for most victories at the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix (six) and is the third most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins.<br>
         <br>
        Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Alain Prost.  Both the 1989 Championship won by Prost and the 1990 Championship won by Senna were decided by collisions between them at those years' Japanese Grands Prix.

        The 2003 F1 season commenced on March 9, 2003 and ended on October 12 after sixteen races.  Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) beat Kimi Raikkonen (McLaren) by two points to the title and Ferrari won the constructors championship.<br>
        <br>
        The 2003 season saw the introduction of new regulations intended to increase F1's excitement and to help alleviate the financial difficulties of the smaller teams.  One-lap qualifying was introduced as a way for smaller teams to get more television exposure.  Optional Friday testing at Grand Prix events was introduced in exchange for less miles on stand alone test days.  This was intended to give smaller teams a cheaper alternative to these test days, which were to be banned in 2004.  Only one type of wet weather tyre was allowed to be used in wet weather races.  The point scoring systems for both the Constructors and Drivers titles were changed from 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 for the first six finishers at each round to 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 for the first eight finishers in an attempt to make the title contests closer.<br>
        <br>
        While Ferrari's Michael Schumacher had won the 2002 championship by 67 points from his team-mate Rubens Barrichello, the 2003 season was much closer.  For a great part of the 2003 season, several drivers from several teams had mathematical chances of winning the world championship.  Eight different drivers won a Grand Prix, amongst them three first time winners.  Kimi Raikkonen, driving for McLaren-Mercedes, and Juan Pablo Montoya, driving for BMW Williams.  Both had a chance of claiming the 2003 championship until late in the season, with Raikkonen still mathematically in contention at the final race, the Japanese Grand Prix.  Raikkonen lost the championship to Schumacher by two points, although he won only one race to Schumacher's six.  Ferrari's defence of the constructor's title was challenged throughout the year by Williams and McLaren, one of the few seasons where there were three front running teams.<br>
        <br>
        Notable races include the chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix which was hampered by monsoon conditions, and the British Grand Prix where the track was invaded by the now-defrocked priest Neil Horan, who ran onto the Hangar straight, running towards the 250 km/h train of cars, wearing a green kilt and waving religious banners.<br>
        <br>
        After failing to complete the 2002 season due to financial difficulties, the Arrows team had their application for admission to the 2003 championship rejected by the FIA prior to the season start date. No reason was publicly given by the FIA and Arrows subsequently folded after 25 years in Formula One

Regarded by many as the greatest driver of all time, Fangio was held in high regard by the drivers.  In his final race, Mike Hawthorn had lapped Fangio, but just before Hawthorn crossed the line, he braked to allow Fangio through so that he could complete the full race distance.

        A mini sheet of 9 values featuring the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix.  The race was held at the A1-Ring circuit; it was infamous for the "staged finish", where race leader Rubens Barrichello, was ordered to allow Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher to overtake him under "team orders" and win the Grand Prix.  Ferrari wanted their number one driver Schumacher to win the race and collect the maximum points for the Drivers' Championship.  Barrichello let him pass on the last lap at the finish line which greatly upset the spectators.  Barrichello had also yielded second place to Schumacher at the line in the previous year's event.<br>
         <br>
        On the podium, in response to the jeers of the crowd, Schumacher insisted that Barrichello take the top spot on the podium.  Schumacher took the trophy for first place from the Austrian chancellor and gave it to Barrichello, who then took the second place trophy.  Barrichello, Schumacher and Ferrari were fined one million U.S. dollars for the failure to observe Article 170 of the Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the podium ceremony.  As a result of this, and another incident at the United States Grand Prix, the FIA declared new rules against "team orders" artificially affecting race results.

        The Scuderia Ferrari team was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929 and became the racing team of Alfa Romeo, building and racing cars under the Alfa name.  In 1938, Alfa Romeo management made the decision to enter racing under its own name, establishing the Alfa Corse organisation, which adsorbed what had been Scuderia Ferrari.  Enzo Ferrari disagreed with this change in policy and was finally dismissed by Alfa in 1939.  The terms of his leaving forbade him from motorsport under his own name, for a period of four years.<br>
        <br>
        In 1947 Ferrari constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5 L Tipo 125, the first racing car to bear the Ferrari name.  A Formula One version of the Tipo 125, the Ferrari 125 F1 was developed in 1948 and entered in several Grand Prix, at the time a World Championship had not yet been established.<br>
        <br>
        In 1950, the Formula One World Championship was established, and Scuderia Ferrari entered in this first season.  It is the only team to have competed in every season of the World Championship, from its inception to the current day.

        A mini sheet with two values featuring Felipe Massa.<br>
        <br>
        Felipe Massa started driving for Ferrari in 2006 (having previously spent three years with Sauber).<br>
        <br>
        His best result to date came in 2008 when he was runner up in the drivers' championship - just losing out to Lewis Hamilton in a dramatic end to the season at the Brazilian Grand Prix.  Going into the last lap, if the order stayed as it was, then Massa would have been champion.  Massa crossed the chequered flag first and thought that he had won the championship.  Hamilton was sixth as he came up to the second-to-last corner, but then passed Glock who had just been overtaken by Vettel and who was struggling for grip on his dry tyres (in the wet), and so this moved him into 5th place.  Crossing the line Hamilton won the Drivers title by a just a single point.  If he had tied points with Massa, by virtue of 6 victories to 5 in the season, Massa would have won the title.

        A miniature sheet containing 4 stamps depicting the McLaren MP4/22; it was revealed in testing at Circuit de Valencia in Spain on 15 January 2007.  In its first race, the 2007 Australian Grand Prix at Melbourne, the car achieved second and fourth in qualifying and second and third places in the race, in the hands of Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton.<br>
        <br>
        In its design philosophy behind the new car, the team says the MP4/22 features "some advanced engineering concepts" and "novel aerodynamic solutions".  On 17 January 2007, Fernando Alonso completed a shakedown test in the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia, setting the fastest lap time of 1:12.050.<br>
        <br>
        The MP4/22 has proved to be far more competitive than its similar looking predecessor and McLaren scored 8 victories, unlike in 2006.  The car proved to be the most reliable car of the season, with no mechanical retirements in the first 15 races, and one of the two fastest cars on the field (along with the Ferraris). The low downforce package of the MP4/22 was extremely competitive.  McLaren, with the aid of their improved car, scored as many team points in the first half of 2007 as they had done during the entire year in 2006.

        A miniature sheet showing various Ferrari cars, which includes the Ferrari 246 F1.<br>
        <br>
        The Ferrari 246 F1 was a Ferrari racing car built for the Formula One World Championship of 1958.<br>
        <br>
        The 246 used a 2417 cc Dino V6 engine with a 65degree angle between the cylinder banks.  This was the first use of a V6 engine in a Formula One car, but otherwise the 246 was a conventional front engine design.  The Ferrari 246 was good enough to win a World Championship for Mike Hawthorn and a second place in the Constructors Championship for Ferrari.<br>
        <br>
        The Ferrari 246 was not only the first V6 engined car to win a Formula One Grand Prix, the French Grand Prix at Reims in 1958, it was also the last front engined car to win a Formula One Grand Prix.  This occurred at the 1960 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, where the major British teams boycotted the race.<br>
        <br>
        In 1960, the Ferrari 246 designation was also used for the first mid-engined Ferrari, the 246P Formula One car, again using a Dino V6 engine of 2417 cc.

        During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry with Ayrton Senna, Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell.  In 1986, at the last race of the season, he managed to pip Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title.  Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship.  A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out.  Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team.  After a sabbatical in 1992, Prost joined the Williams team, prompting reigning drivers' champion Mansell to leave for CART.  With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship but he retired at the end of the year rather than be teammates with Senna who signed for 1994.<br>
        <br>
        Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modeling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark.  He was nicknamed 'The Professor' for his intellectual approach to competition.  Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early on in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end of the race.

        Senna is regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of Formula One.  In 2009, a poll of 217 current and former Formula One drivers chose Senna as their greatest Formula One driver, in a survey conducted by British magazine Autosport.  He was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap and from 1989 until 2006 held the record for most pole positions.  He was among the most talented drivers in extremely rain-affected conditions, as shown by his performances in the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix.  He also holds the record for most victories at the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix (6) and is the third most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins.  However, Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Alain Prost, which was marked by two championship-deciding collisions at the 1989 and 1990 Japanese Grands Prix.

        The McLaren MP4/4 was one of most dominant F1 cars ever built.  It was designed by Steve Nichols and Gordon Murray and was based on the previous year's lowline Brabham BT55.  In the hands of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost (in 1988) the car secured 15 poles and 15 wins out of the 16 races.<br>
        <br>
        The lowline concept was that a low car with a reduced front area of about 30% would be more aerodynamically efficient and allow more to pass over the rear wing causing more downforce to be produced, but without excessive drag.  The recently acquired Honda engine was ideally suited to this concept with its low centre of gravity as it did not exhibit the problems of the previous year's Brabham (fuel and oil starvation).  The combination of the lowline concept and the Honda engine are what made this car so dominant.

        <br>
        The 1979 French Grand Prix, which was held on 1 July 1979 at Dijon.  It marked the first victory of a turbocharged car in F1, with Renault overcoming the reliability problems that had initially plagued their car.  For Jean-Pierre Jabouille it was a victory on home soil, driving a French car (Renault), on French tyres (Michelin), powered by a French engine (Renault), burning French fuel (Elf).<br>
        <br>
        The race is also remembered for one of the fiercest battles ever for second place, between Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve and Renault driver Rene Arnoux, who on several occasions during the final laps touched wheels and swapped positions.  The fight is often cited as one of the most memorable pieces of racing in F1.  Villeneuve, who passed the finish line less than half a second ahead of Arnoux, later described the occasion as "my best memory of Grand Prix racing".

        Grand Prix motor racing originated in France and the French Grand Prix is the oldest Grand Prix race, first run on 26 June 1906 under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France, with a starting field of 32 automobiles.  The circuit used, which was based in Le Mans, was roughly triangular in shape, each lap covering 65 miles. Six laps were to run each day, and each lap took approximately an hour using the relatively primitive cars of the day, the race distance was 780 miles.<br>
        <br>
        The first World Championships were organized in 1925 with the French Grand Prix, the Italian Grand Prix, the Belgian Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500. The French Grand Prix has been part of the F1 championship since its inception in 1950.

        In his first year driving for Red Bull in 2009, Vettel finished the season as the youngest-ever World Drivers' championship runner-up. The following year he went on to become the youngest driver ever to win the World Drivers' Championship. In the same year he helped Red Bull win the team's first World Constructors' Championship. He followed up his first championship with a second in 2011, becoming the youngest double as well as youngest consecutive champion. Vettel won the 2012 F1 World Championship, becoming the youngest triple champion in the history of the sport.<br>
        <br>
        Vettel holds numerous other "youngest" Formula One records, among them: the youngest driver to have taken part in an official practice session of a Grand Prix, to score championship points, to lead a race, to secure pole position, and to win a race.

        The Mercedes-Benz W196 was produced for the 1954 and 1955 seasons.  In the hands of Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss it won 9 of 12 races entered and captured the only two world (drivers) championships in which it competed.<br>
        <br>
        Firsts included the use of desmodromic valves and Daimler-Benz developed mechanical direct fuel injection adapted from the DB 601 high-performance V12 used on the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter during World War II.<br>
        <br>
        Two variants were produced, the aerodynamic closed-wheel aluminium "Type Monza" streamliner was used only at Monza (where it picked up its nickname) and Silverstone, but was found to be really only suited to high-speed tracks made up of straights and slow corners.  It was defeated at Silverstone (a high-speed corner dominated circuit), so the open wheel version was introduced for the German Grand Prix.<br>
        <br>
        At the end of the 1955 season Mercedes withdrew from motorsport.

        <br>
        As of 2017, Rosberg is the only driver to win the championship apart from Sebastian Vettel and Hamilton since 2010.  He is also only the second son of a former champion, after Damon Hill, to have won the title himself, and the first to have achieved this feat while his father is alive, and in a car bearing the same racing number as his father's car (6).  He is also the first-ever German F1 driver to win a title in a German team with a German engine.<br>
        <br>
        Rosberg won the International Racing Driver Award at the 2016 Autosport Awards.  The award was first won by his father Keke in 1982.<br>
        <br>
        Rosberg announced his immediate retirement from F1 on 2 December 2016 at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony in Vienna.  The decision came after he reached the 'pinnacle' of his career after winning the 2016 World Drivers' Championship.  He was the first reigning champion to do so since Alain Prost in 1993.

        Jacques Villeneuve won the drivers championship in 1997 in his second year in F1 (and his second year with Williams) in the FW19.  After a third year with Williams he moved to BAR for the next 5 years, but achieved little success.  In 2004 he drove a few races for Renault, before switching to Sauber for 2005 and 2006.<br>
        <br>
        Kimi Raikkonen drove for McLaren from 2002 to 2006; in that time he was runner up twice in the drivers championship.  Raikkonen is known to be very calm, cool, and calculating in his race strategy - prompting the nickname "Iceman", which is subtly written on the side of his current helmet design.  Raikkonen was always known to be extremely fast but his infamous technical failures did not bring the results that he deserved. Approximately 38% of his races during his 5 years with McLaren ended with retirement because of one technical failure or the other.<br>
        <br>
        David Coulthard drove for McLaren from 1996 to 2004; in that time he was runner up once and third place three times in the drivers championship.  Coulthard amassed a notable points haul placing him seventh on the all-time scorers list, being the top British scorer, in an F1 career spanning 15 seasons with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull Racing.<br>
        <br>
        Michael Schumacher and Ferrari - enough said.

The elusive first win came at the Hungarian grand prix in 2006 in the wet.  At the end of 2008 Honda pulled out of F1 and the team became Brawn GP in 2009 following a management buyout - after years of having uncompetitive cars the Brawn BGP001 won 6 of the first 7 races and took Button to a well deserved drivers title and handed Brawn GP the constructors title.<br>

        Johnny Herbert drove in F1 off and on from 1989 to 2000, starting out with Benetton and Tyrrell.  He then did a 4 year stint with Lotus, before moving back to Benetton via Ligier (for one race), after that Herbert moved to Sauber for 3 years, Stewart for 1 year and finally Jaguar for 1 year.  Herbert achieved only 3 race victories: 1995 British and Italian Grand Prix (Benetton) and 1999 European Grand Prix which was held at Nurburgring (Stewart).  During the mid-1980s, Johnny Herbert was widely regarded as a coming man of motor racing, comparable to the Scot Jim Clark.  Disaster struck in 1988, though, as Herbert, then a championship hopeful in International Formula 3000 was caught up in a major accident at Brands Hatch, badly breaking his legs in a fearsome impact with the barriers.  It was an act of huge bravery that saw him back in a racing car at the beginning of 1989, despite the fact he could barely walk.

        Ricardo Patrese drove for Williams from 1987 (just the final race, replacing the injured Mansell) to 1992; in that time he was runner up in 1992 and third place in 1989 and 1991 in the drivers championship.  Williams dominated F1 in 1992 and Patrese continued to deliver in his role of second driver to Nigel Mansell, moving out of the way for Mansell while leading comfortably at that year's French Grand Prix.  Patrese took a single win at the Japanese Grand Prix and had eight other podium finishes, including six second-place results.  With Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell all desperately trying to sign for Williams, Patrese's position looked to be under threat and he signed for Benetton before the end of the year.  Ironically, only Prost was able to agree terms with Williams for 1993, leaving a seat free for Patrese had he remained with the team.

        A commemorative sheet featuring Ayrton Senna.  The sheet also depicts two of Senna's closest rivals Alain Prost and Gehard Berger.  One of the greatest rivalries in F1 was that of Senna and Prost, which started in 1988 when Senna joined Prost at McLaren and continued until 1993 when Prost signed a contract with Williams that had a clause forbidding Senna from becoming his teammate.<br>
        <br>
        Despite the bitter rivalry between Senna and Prost, the two had the utmost respect for one another.  This was evidenced by the fact that Prost was a pallbearer at Senna's funeral.  Years later Prost would say a part of him died when Senna perished because their rivalry had been so great.

        A mini sheet of one value featuring Jacques Villeneuve.<br>
        <br>
        Following two successful years in CART, Villeneuve moved into F1 in 1996 with the front running Williams team, alongside Damon Hill.  In his debut season, Villeneuve challenged Hill for the title, winning four races and taking the fight to the final round in Japan, where the Canadian retired and Hill won the title.  Villeneuve, however, did win the following year's title, this time challenging Michael Schumacher and once again taking it to the final round in Jerez.  In the race, the two collided, resulting in Schumacher's retirement and subsequent disqualification from the 1997 World Championship, with Villeneuve going on to take third place in the race, and the overall title.<br>
         <br>
        The last year in which Villeneuve would win a championship level race and finish the season in the top three was 1997.  Renault had pulled out of F1 for 1998 and Villeneuve's Williams team had to fare with less competitive Mecachrome engines.  Villeneuve moved to the newly formed British American Racing team in 1999 and stayed there for the next four seasons but, following poor results he was replaced by former British Formula Three Champion Takuma Sato.  After a short run with Renault at the end of 2004, Villeneuve moved to the Sauber team for the 2005 season where he was outscored by his less experienced teammate Felipe Massa.  The Sauber team were bought out by BMW for the following season and Villeneuve struggled to score points, taking seven points from eleven rounds before suffering an injury in Germany.  The Canadian was replaced by Robert Kubica and soon BMW and Villeneuve parted company.

        The race was won by Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) followed by Mark Weber in the other Red Bull, Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) was third.  The race will be remembered for the storms during Qualifying which mixed up the grid, the result was some great charges from drivers who would normally be at the front on race day.  Ross Brawn believed the mix up to be too much reliance on weather radars and not enough common sense being applied to the conditions - the main casualties of this were the Ferraris and the McLarens.

        <br>
        Enzo Anselmo "the Commendatore" Ferrari (February 20, 1898 - August 14, 1988) was an Italian race car driver and entrepreneur, the founder of the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team, and subsequently of the Ferrari car manufacturer.<br>
        <br>
        In 1923, racing in Ravenna, he acquired the Prancing Horse badge which decorated the fuselage of Francesco Baracca's (Italy's leading ace of WWI) SPAD S.XIII fighter, given from his mother, taken from the wreckage of the plane after his mysterious death. This icon would have to wait until 1932 to be displayed on a racing car.<br>
        <br>
        Ferrari has participated in the Formula 1 World Championship since its introduction in 1950, but the first victory was not until the British Grand Prix of 1951. The first championship came in 1952-53, when the Formula One season was raced with Formula Two cars.

        Jaguar Racing competed in the F1 World Championship from 2000 to 2004. It was formed from the purchase by Ford of Jackie Stewart's Stewart Grand Prix Formula One team in June 1999. Ford renamed the team Jaguar Racing as part of its global marketing operations to promote their Jaguar premium car company. Despite this branding, they continued to use Ford-Cosworth engines in the cars, no Jaguar engineering was involved. During the years of Ford's ownership, the team was unable to revive its performances of 1999 (4th in the Constructor's Championship).

        A single value featuring Ayrton Senna and the Williams FW16.<br>
        <br>
        For 1994, Senna finally signed with the Williams-Renault team after Prost had reluctantly decided to end his career.  Prost's contract clause forbidding Senna from joining Williams did not extend to 1994 and Prost retired with one year left on his contract, rather than face the prospect of a repeat of the animosities of 1989 and 1990.  Pre-season testing showed that the new Williams FW16 car had speed, but it was extremely difficult to control.  Senna himself had made numerous diplomatic comments that the FW16 had some quirks which needed to be ironed out due to the fact that, contractually, he was forbidden from outright criticising the car.  It was obvious that the FW16, after the regulation changes banning active suspension, traction control, power brakes, and ABS, exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and FW14B cars that had preceded it.  It was also the first season that Williams used power steering, a system which had been problematic.  Furthermore, the cockpit was too tight for Senna's frame, and several adjustments were subsequently made, including the lengthening of the steering column by 12 millimetres.  The surprise of testing was the Benetton team, whose car was more nimble than the Williams although less powerful. Senna prophetically commented, "It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen."

        In 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team which had last won the Drivers' Championship with Jody Scheckter in 1979 and which had not won the Constructors' Championship since 1983. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired. A year later, ex-Benetton employees Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn, who had been Technical Director at Benetton since 1991, and who was one of the key members behind Schumacher's title successes with the team in 1994 and 1995, decided to join Schumacher at Ferrari. This increased Schumacher's motivation to build a more experienced and potentially championship-winning team around him.<br>
        <br>
        Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s. At the end of 1995, though the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.<br>
        <br>
        Schumacher, Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne, and Jean Todt (hired in 1993), have been credited as turning this once struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history. Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believes the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.<br>
        <br>
        Eddie Irvine also joined the team, moving from Jordan in 1996.  In 1999, his last year with Ferrari, he achieved his best result of 2nd place in the Drivers' Championship.

        Lotus 25 - The Lotus 25 was designed by Colin Chapman for the 1962 Formula One season.  It was a revolutionary design, the first fully stressed monocoque chassis to appear in F1.  The original sketches for the car were made on napkins while Chapman discussed his idea while dining out with Lotus chassis designer Mike Costin.  The car gave Jim Clark his first Grand Prix victory, at Spa that year.<br>
        <br>
        Maserati 250F - The Maserati 250F was used in '2.5 litre' F1 racing between January 1954 and November 1960.  Twenty-six examples were made.  The 250F first raced in the 1954 Argentine Grand Prix where Juan Manuel Fangio won the first of his two victories before he left for the new Mercedes-Benz team. Fangio won the 1954 Drivers' World Championship, with points gained with both Maserati and Mercedes-Benz; Stirling Moss raced his own privately owned 250F for the full 1954 season.<br>
        <br>
        Ferrari 246 F1 - The Ferrari 246 F1 was built for the F1 World Championship of 1958.  The regulations for 1954-1960 limited naturally aspirated engines to 2500cc and for the 1958 season there was a change from alcohol fuels to AvGas.  The 246 used a 2417 cc Dino V6 engine with a 65degree angle between the cylinder banks.  This was the first use of a V6 engine in a F1 car, but otherwise the 246 was a conventional front engine design.  The Ferrari 246 was good enough to win a World Championship for Mike Hawthorn and a second place in the Constructors Championship for Ferrari.<br>
        <br>
        Lotus 49 - The Lotus 49 was designed by Colin Chapman and Maurice Philippe for the 1967 F1 season.  It was designed around the Cosworth DFV engine that would power most of the F1 grid through the 1970s and was the first successful F1 car to feature the engine as a structural member.  Jim Clark won on the car's debut in 1967, and it would also provide him with the last win of his career in 1968.  Graham Hill went on to win that year's title and the car continued winning races until 1970.

        The son of a wealthy Brazilian landowner, Ayrton Senna developed an interest in motor racing at an early age.<br>
        <br>
        Senna was Catholic. A very religious man, he openly conflated his beliefs with his racing, something for which he was criticized as dangerous by Alain Prost, among others. He often read the Bible on long flights from Sao Paulo to Europe.<br>
        <br>
        Senna expressed concern over the widespread poverty in Brazil, and privately spent millions of his personal fortune on underprivileged children. Shortly before his death he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became Instituto Ayrton Senna.<br>
        <br>
        Senna was often quoted using driving as a means for self-discovery, and racing as a metaphor for life: "The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation."<br>
        <br>
        Towards the end of his career Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death he initiated the re-formation of the GPDA safety organisation, with which he would work to improve the safety of his sport. Shortly before his death, Senna spoke of Formula 1 saying "you are always exposed to danger, danger of getting hurt, danger of dying. This is your life, and you either approach it in a, in a professional, in a cool manner or you just drop it, leave it alone and don't do it anymore. And I happen to like too much what I do to just drop it, I can't drop it".<br>
        <br>
        He was renowned for his close relationship with Gerhard Berger, and the two were always playing practical jokes on each other. Berger is quoted as saying "He taught me a lot about our sport, I taught him to laugh". In the documentary film The Right to Win made in 2004 as a tribute to Senna, Frank Williams notably recalls that as good a driver as Senna was, ultimately "he was an even greater man outside of the car than he was in it."

        The Ferguson P99 was a four-wheel drive F1 car built by Ferguson Research Ltd for the Rob Walker Racing Team.  It was the first 4WD F1 car and used a Climax 1.5 litre engine.

        <br>
        In a 1997 interview for Motor Sport magazine, Sir Stirling Moss nominated the P99 as his favourite of all the F1 cars he drove.  This was considered high praise from a man who drove the Mercedes W196, Maserati 250F, Vanwall and Cooper T51.

        A mini sheet of stamps featuring Juan Manuel Fangio; Fangio dominated he first decade of F1 winning the World Drivers' Championship five times.  Fangio drove for a variety of teams which meant he drove a number of different cars including those from Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati.<br>
        <br>
        Fangio, unlike later F1 drivers, started his racing career at a mature age and was the oldest driver in many of his races.  During his career, drivers raced with almost no protective equipment on circuits with no safety features, although F1 cars back in the 1950s were a lot slower, less physically demanding to drive and less advanced than F1 cars four and more decades later.  Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he would have a better chance with a better car.  As was then common, several of his race results were shared with team mates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems.  His rivals included Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Stirling Moss.  Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Peron.

        The 1994 season was Schumacher's first Drivers' Championship.  The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Ayrton Senna (witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind in 2nd position) and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.<br>
        <br>
        In 1995 Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton.  He now had the same Renault engine as Williams.  He accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Damon Hill.  With team-mate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship and became the youngest two-time world champion in F1 history.

        <br>
        - F150 - 2011, driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 3rd - the car's chassis designation was chosen to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification, although this has been seen by some pundits as a political move by Luca di Montezemolo following criticism for Ferrari's failure to secure the 2010 World Championship at the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.  In February 2011, Ford declared its intention to sue Ferrari over the use of the F150 name, to which Ford owns a trademark.  In response, Ferrari began to refer to the car as the "F150th Italia", claiming the original F150 moniker was simply an abbreviation.<br>
        - F10 - 2010, driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 3rd<br>
        - F60 - 2009, driven by Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 4th - the car was named F60 to celebrate the fact that 2009 is Ferrari's 60th year in Formula One, the only team to have competed every year.<br>
        - F2008 - 2009, driven by Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 1st

        <br>
        Rubens Barrichello drove for Ferrari from 2000 to 2005.  His most successful year was 2002, when he won four races for the team and finished a career best second place in the drivers' championship, scoring 77 championship points.  The year was marked by controversy, however, when Ferrari team orders required Barrichello to allow the trailing Schumacher to pass him on the final straight of the Austrian Grand Prix to take victory.  Schumacher exchanged podium places with Barrichello at the podium ceremony and gave Barrichello the winner's trophy.  The drivers were fined for disrupting podium protocol and Ferrari's blatant team orders led to the FIA banning team orders beginning in 2003.
