      Going into the final race of the season Michael Schumacher (Ferrari F310B) was 1 point ahead of Jacques Villeneuve (Williams Renault FW19) in the championship - the qualifying session for the final race (European Grand Prix, Jerez) was noteworthy, as three drivers, Villeneuve, Schumacher, and Frentzen, all registered the same fastest qualifying time.  Villeneuve was awarded pole position since he had set the time first, and this would be the final pole of his F1 career.  At the start of the race, Schumacher had a good start, overtaking Villeneuve to take the lead.  By lap 48 Villeneuve was catching up to Schumacher and attempted to overtake.  Braking later than the German at the Dry Sac corner, Villeneuve had the inside line and was slightly ahead when Schumacher turned into him, his front right wheel connecting with the sidepod of the Williams car.  Schumacher retired on the spot and Villeneuve went to take third place and earn four points, enough to take the 1997 title.
