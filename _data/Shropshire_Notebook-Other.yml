  Name: Bowyer Yard Lime Kilns, Ironbridge
  Description: |
    Limestone has been quarried in the area of Ironbridge (Benthall Edge) since medieval times, but it became immensely important during the 18th and 19th Centuries.  Whilst much the best limestone was transported to the ironmaking furnaces on the north side of the river, other grades of limestone was processed in limekilns at the eastern end of the woods, south of the river.

    The limekilns are one of the best preserved monuments of an industry which was once of great importance in the Gorge.  A steep inclined plane linked the kilns with the quarries on Benthall Edge.

    It is known that the kilns closed sometime in the mid-19th Century and then had a brief commercial revival in the 1920s and 1930s when perhaps the economics of extraction became favourable again.

    In 2010 the trust rasied £70,000 to repair the lime kilns. Sections of the top and  corner were rebuilt as was the buttress. the remaining parts where repointed and a new saftey fence was erected.

    Tiddicross Field, situated to the west of Wrockwardine on the road to Charlton, was purchased for charitable purposes in 1657, when the rents of the property, upon which a house and barn were later built, were divided annually between the poor of the parish. The cost of relieving local poverty rose rapidly during the 17th and 18th Centuries and in 1782 the parish authorities were forced to rent a cottage in which to house the local poor.  By 1801, a new parish workhouse was deemed necessary and a purpose-built facility was constructed on Tiddicross Field.

  Name: The Holy Grail & The Da Vinci Code, Hodnet
  Description: |
    In 2006, the interior of Hodnet church was damaged by people apparantly seeking clues as to the whereabouts of the Holy Grail.  The damage was caused to stonework beneath the stained glass window depicting the Four Evangelists, this window shows St John with an apparently feminine appearance - this is one of the major themes of the best-selling novel by Dan Brown.  Not only does the figure appear to be a woman, but the figure is wearing a woman's gown and is holding a golden chalice (the traditional depiction of the Holy Grail).

    On 25/08/2006, the BBC reported that:

    *A number of holes were chiselled into the stonework of the Grade I-listed 14th Century church in the nave, near the choir vestry door and by a stained glass window.*

    The article also commented that:

    *The church also features strongly in The Chalice of Magdalene, written by "historical detective" Graham Phillips.*

    *In it, his search for the Holy Grail leads him to St Luke's and the stained glass window. The story also features on the author's website.*

    The reality is that Shropshire Antiquarian Thomas Wright (1810 to 1877) claimed to have the Chalice of Magdalene.  In the spirit of Arthurian legend, he hid it at Hawkstone Park (as the owner was building a park and garden at the time) and left a series of clues to its whereabouts.  The chalice was hidden in one of four statues depicting a bull, a lion, an angel and an eagle (the symbols for the four gospels) - the statues were placed in a cavern in the White Cliff at Hawkstone Park.  In the window above the figures are the four symbols - the window is dated 1846 and was sponsored by Thomas Wright.  In the 1920s, an attempt was made to move the statues and in the process the eagle (St John) statue was broken revealing a cavity containing a small stone cup.  The cup was confirmed by the British Museum as being a green alabaster ointment or scent jar from the 1st Century AD.

  Name: Ludford Water Mill, Ludlow
  Description: |
    Ludford Mill is a 16th Century Water Mill (and now a private dwelling).

    In front of Ludford Mill is a stepped structure.  This houses the Ludlow Hydro Co-Operative's Archimedes Screw installation.  It was completed in 2016 at a cost of £400,000 (financed by a community body supported by 170 local people and others committed to eco-friendly electricity production).  The Screw harnesses the power of the millrace to generate electricity, enough to light a bulb in every house in Ludlow and Ludford year round.

    Whenever the river level is high enough, water is channelled into the top of the Screw, most of the generated electricity is fed into the National Grid.  The Screw design was chosen as it is the most wildlife friendly design.

  Name: The Railway, Broseley
  Description: |
    Broseley developed as an industrial area due to the abundance of coal, clay, iron ore and limestone easily workable in one area, also the woods provided charcoal and the River Severn transport.  In fact, the mines in Broseley and the adjoining parish of Benthall became of national importance in the seventeenth century.

    This industrialisation drove innovation - a document of 1605 refers to a railway line from Birch Leasows, Broseley to the Calcutts, this is only the second railway for which evidence survives in England (making it one of the oldest railways in England).  A railway at the time would have horse drawn wagons on flanged wheels (meaning that greater loads could be moved with the same effort).

  Name: Conservatory at Sunnycroft, Wellington
  Description: |
    Built in 1899AD, the conservatory is now one of only two known examples of its kind still standing, built by R Halliday & Co.  The Halliday conservatory would have been a state of the art horticultural as well as architectural masterpiece, a statement of great pride for Mrs Slaney (Sunnycroft's owner) who grew prize-winning exotic ferns (most likely in the conservatory).  She is listed as a member of the Shropshire Horticultural Society in 1906 and programmes for the Royal Agricultural Society’s (Shrewsbury) show and Shrewsbury Flower Show of 1914 are in Sunnycroft’s archive. Mrs Slaney’s gardener Mr Stevenson regularly displayed and won first and second prizes for exotic ferns in August each year at the Shropshire Horticultural Association Show, as recorded in the Gardener’s Chronicle in 1894, 1897, 1900, 1901 and 1906.
