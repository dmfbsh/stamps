      A stamp issue commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Boavista circuit.<br>
      <br>
      The Circuito da Boavista was a street circuit in Oporto, Portugal - it was used twice for F1 races in 1958 and 1960.<br>
      <br>
      The 1958 event is remembered for an act of good sportsmanship by Stirling Moss.  Moss came to the defense of fellow countryman (and title rival) Mike Hawthorn, who had run afoul of the stewards (and oncoming traffic) during an off-track excursion during the race.  Moss (who won the race) persuaded the stewards not to disqualify Hawthorn, preserving second place, and 6 points, for Hawthorn, who would eventually win the drivers championship by 1 point over Moss.<br>
      <br>
      The 1960 running was a race of attrition, with only four cars finishing within 5 laps of winner Jack Brabham.  Accidents and mechanical problems ended the day early for future champions John Surtees, Phil Hill, Graham Hill and others.
