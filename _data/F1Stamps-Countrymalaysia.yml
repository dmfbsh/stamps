      The 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix was held at the Sepang International Circuit on 17th October 1999; this was the first F1 race to be held in Malaysia.  Michael Schumacher returned to Formula One having recovered from his broken leg.  Immediately after the race the two Ferraris were disqualified due to an infringement on their bargeboards.  This meant that Mika Hakkinen was handed the championship by default.  However, Ferrari appealed against the FIA's decision in court and both drivers were subsequently reinstated.  The race was won by Eddie Irvine, Michael Schumacher was second and Mika Hakkinen third.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke, who would subsequently design the new facilities in Shanghai, Bahrain and Turkey.  The main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is 5.54 kilometres long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights.  The layout is quite unusual, with a very long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin.
