      A set of 8 stamps showing various Ferrari F1 cars.<br>
      <br>
      1957 - 801 - derived from the Ferrari D50 (in which Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1956 drivers championship), the 801 was largely uncompetitive against the latest generation of Maserati 250Fs<br>
      1959 - 256 (should be 246?) F1 - successor to the 801, provided Ferrari with second place in the constructors championship<br>
      1960 - 246 P F1 - the first mid-engined Ferrari F1 car - provided Ferrari with third place in the constructors championship<br>
      1966 - 246 F1 (should be 312?) - a win at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix enabled Ferrari to finish second in the constructors championship<br>
      1971 - 312 B2 - 1971 started with a win by new signing Mario Andretti, followed by another win for Jacky Ickx - Ferrari came second in the Constructors Championship<br>
      1969 - 312 F1 - During 1969 Enzo Ferrari set about spending his newfound wealth (from the sale of the road car business to Fiat) to revive his struggling team; though Ferrari did compete in Formula One in 1969, it was something of a throwaway season while the team was restructured<br>
      1997 - F310 B - driven by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine to second place in the constructors championship - Schumacher was actually disqualified from the drivers championship for causing an avoidable accident<br>
      2002 - F2002 - one of the most successful Formula One car designs of all time - designed by Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Paolo Martinelli, it won fifteen Grands Prix, from a total of nineteen races in 2002 and 2003
