      Grand Prix motor racing originated in France and the French Grand Prix, open to international competition, is the oldest Grand Prix race, first run on 26 June 1906 under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France in Sarthe.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit used, which was based in Le Mans, was roughly triangular in shape, each lap covering 105 kilometres (65 miles).  Six laps were run each day, and each lap took approximately an hour to complete.<br>
      <br>
      There were 32 entrants - the race was won by Hungarian Ferenc Szisz driving a Renault.<br>
