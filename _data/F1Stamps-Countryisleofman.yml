In both 1986 and 1987, Mansell was partnered by Nelson Piquet and came 2nd in the F1 World Drivers Championship; but Williams took the F1 World Constructors championship in both of these years.

      1992 would be Mansell's finest season, these stamps celebrate him becoming World Champion. He started the year with five straight victories (a record equalled by Michael Schumacher in 2004). At Monaco, the sixth race of the season, he took pole and dominated much of the race. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton Senna's McLaren-Honda. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna's and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just two tenths of a second behind the Brazilian. Mansell was crowned Formula One Drivers' Champion early in the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where his second place finish clinched the Drivers' Championship, securing the title in the least number of Grands Prix since the 16-race season format started. This stood as a record until broken by Schumacher in 2002. Mansell also set the then-record for the most number of wins in one season (9) and highest number of pole positions (14).

    Description: |
      Mike Hailwood was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer regarded by many as one of the greatest racers of all time.  He became one of the few men to compete at Grand Prix level in both motorcycle and car racing.<br>
      <br>
      In F1, Hailwood drove for Reg Parnell Racing in 1963, 1964 and 1965 without much success.  In 1971, 1972 and 1973 he drove for Team Surtees, again more often than not retiring from races.  However, in 1972 he achieved his best result in F1 coming second at the Italian Grand Prix.  In his final season of F1, 1974, he drove for McLaren, and finished 11th in the Drivers' Championship.  He left Formula One after being injured badly at the 1974 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, so did complete the season with McLaren.<br>
      <br>
      Hailwood was recognised for his bravery when in the 1973 South African Grand Prix he went to pull Clay Regazzoni from his burning car after the two collided on the second lap of the race.  Hailwood's driving suit caught fire, but after being extinguished by a fire marshall he returned to help rescue Regazzoni, an act for which he was awarded the George Medal, the 2nd highest gallantry award that a British civilian can be awarded.
