      A souvenir sheet featuring the 10th anniversary of the Foster's Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, Melbourne.<br>
      <br>
      The Australian Grand Prix was originally held at Adelaide, a street circuit considered to be one of greatest in the world.  The race was held there from 1985 to 1995.  From 1996 the race ws moved to Melbourne, this was a controversial move and a series of protests were organised by the "Save Albert Park" group, as it meant turning a public park into a private playground for one week each year.  Approximately 401,000 people turned out for the first race at Albert Park.<br>
      <br>
      The Adelaide races were always the final race of each season; whereas the Albert Park races tend to be season openers, and so have seen many debuts.
