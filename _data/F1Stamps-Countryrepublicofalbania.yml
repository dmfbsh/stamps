      The history of Formula One has its roots in the European Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s.  However, the foundation of Formula One began in 1946 with the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA's) standardisation of rules.  A World Drivers' Championship followed in 1950.  The sport's history necessarily parallels the history of its technical regulations.  Although the world championship has always been the main focus of the category, non-championship Formula One races were held for many years.  Due to the rising cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.
