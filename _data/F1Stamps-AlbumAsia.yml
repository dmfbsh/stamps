        A 2 stamp sheet showing Ayrton Senna and the Williams Renault FW16.<br>
        <br>
        Ayrton Senna started racing in F1 with Toleman in 1984, in 1985 he joined Lotus for three years.  Then in 1988 Senna joined the then-double world champion, Alain Prost, at McLaren - over the next 5 years there was a dramatic rivalry between the two drivers, which culminated in a number of dramatic race incidents (most famously, two championship deciding collisions at the 1989 and 1990 Japanese Grands Prix).  The dominant MP4/4 took Senna to his first world title in 1988.<br>
        <br>
        In 1994 Senna signed for Williams - Williams had won the previous two world championships in superior cars.  In this year the FIA had banned electronic aids to make the sport more "human", the FW16 had speed but was difficult to drive.  Senna failed to finish the first two races of the season, but placed the FW16 on pole position for the San Marino Grand Prix, his 65th pole.  On 1st May 1994, Senna was leading the San Marino Grand Prix, when his FW16 left the track at the high speed Tamburello corner, hitting the concrete wall at 135mph.

        A set of stamps commemorating 10 years of F1 at the Bahrain International Circuit.<br>
        <br>
        The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on April 4, 2004, making history as the first F1 Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Bahrain fought off competition from elsewhere in the region to stage the race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates all hoping for the prestige of hosting a F1 Grand Prix.<br>
        <br>
        The 2014 race was held as a night race under floodlights. It became the second F1 night race after the Singapore Grand Prix, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Grand Prix. It was won by Lewis Hamilton.

        <br>
        The Bahrain International Circuit at Sakhir was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke.  Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However, organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive on the sand around the track.  The surface of the track is made of Graywacke aggregate, shipped to Bahrain from the Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire.  The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula 1 drivers for the high level of grip it offers. The same aggregate material is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

        <br>
        The 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix was held at the Sepang International Circuit on 17th October 1999; this was the first F1 race to be held in Malaysia.  Michael Schumacher returned to Formula One having recovered from his broken leg.  Immediately after the race the two Ferraris were disqualified due to an infringement on their bargeboards.  This meant that Mika Hakkinen was handed the championship by default.  However, Ferrari appealed against the FIA's decision in court and both drivers were subsequently reinstated.  The race was won by Eddie Irvine, Michael Schumacher was second and Mika Hakkinen third.<br>
        <br>
        The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke, who would subsequently design the new facilities in Shanghai, Bahrain and Turkey.  The main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is 5.54 kilometres long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights.  The layout is quite unusual, with a very long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin.

      Description: |
        A set of 7 stamps showing various racing cars.  The 30m depicts the McLaren M23.  The McLaren M23 was a F1 car mostly inspired by the Lotus 72 and the same Ford DFV engine was used.<br>
        <br>
        It was introduced for the 1973 season, and scored pole position with Denny Hulme on its very first outing.  Scheckter was responsible for one of the biggest accidents F1 has ever seen at the 1973 British Grand Prix, spinning his M23 in front of the pack. This was before Emerson Fittipaldi joined McLaren from Lotus in 1974. His knowledge of the Lotus 72 helped McLaren develop the M23 and that season, Fittipaldi gave McLaren its first drivers' and constructors' world championships, beating Ferrari, Tyrrell and Lotus.<br>
        <br>
        Further development in 1975 helped Fittipaldi and McLaren to second in both championships. Fittipaldi was replaced by James Hunt, who went on to win a dramatic and controversial 1976 season with the final evolution M23.  When the replacement McLaren M26 proved troublesome, Hunt and Jochen Mass relied on the M23 in the early part of the 1977 season, and even though the car was now 4 years old, it was still competitive.<br>
        <br>
        The M23 was never the most technically advanced F1 car, but sound preparation and continual development helped it win 16 grands prix, 2 drivers' and a constructors' world championship in its lifetime.

        A mini sheet of one value featuring the Ferrari F1/89 (aka 640) built for the 1989 season.  It was driven by Nigel Mansell and Gerhard Berger.<br>
        <br>
        The car was designed by John Barnard, and it was the first Ferrari he was responsible for designing.  It sported a sharp nose, with a narrow monocoque and bulging side-pods designed to house the radiators with maximum aerodynamic efficiency.  The 640 was powered by Ferrari's own 3.5 litre V12 engine which produced up to 660bhp, a fine effort considering that it was the team's first naturally aspirated engine for almost a decade.  However, the transmission it was mated to attracted more attention, as it contained the very first 7-speed semi-automatic gearbox seen in F1.  In its first season, it proved to be very unreliable, and hampered Ferrari's efforts throughout the year.  However, such gearboxes would become the norm by the mid-1990s.<br>
        <br>
        The car proved to be fast, and it won its debut race, despite fears of unreliability and underwent a number of minor modifications that allowed Mansell and Berger to net three wins between them, including a win at Estoril where the Ferraris were clearly more competitive than the McLarens.  Although Berger failed to finish the first eleven races of the season, the carbon-fibre chassis did prove to be very strong however, and allowed Berger to escape from a fiery high speed crash in San Marino with only minor burns to his hands and a couple of broken ribs.  When the car did finish races, it never finished lower than 3rd place.

        - Sauber C36 - The C36 is the first Sauber built after the team's takeover by Longbow Finance S.A.  Originally intended to be the last Sauber car to be fitted with Ferrari engines, after the team secured a deal to run with customer and up-to-date Honda powered engines for the 2018 season, the deal to run with Honda powered engines was cancelled on 27 July 2017 and the team eventually secured another year of Ferrari engines for 2018.<br>
        <br>
        - McLaren MP4-29 - in 2014 the cars sported a Mobil 1 livery to honour the team's 20-year association with the brand.  At the season opener both cars scored podium finishes, however this was followed by disappointing performances, including both cars unable to complete the Bahrain Grand Prix due to technical reasons.  The team failed to record another podium finish all season, and although statistically the MP4-29 was the most mechanically reliable car of the season with 36 classified finishes out of a possible 38, they ultimately finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship.

        Going into the final race of the season Michael Schumacher (Ferrari F310B) was 1 point ahead of Jacques Villeneuve (Williams Renault FW19) in the championship - the qualifying session for the final race (European Grand Prix, Jerez) was noteworthy, as three drivers, Villeneuve, Schumacher, and Frentzen, all registered the same fastest qualifying time.  Villeneuve was awarded pole position since he had set the time first, and this would be the final pole of his F1 career.  At the start of the race, Schumacher had a good start, overtaking Villeneuve to take the lead.  By lap 48 Villeneuve was catching up to Schumacher and attempted to overtake.  Braking later than the German at the Dry Sac corner, Villeneuve had the inside line and was slightly ahead when Schumacher turned into him, his front right wheel connecting with the sidepod of the Williams car.  Schumacher retired on the spot and Villeneuve went to take third place and earn four points, enough to take the 1997 title.
