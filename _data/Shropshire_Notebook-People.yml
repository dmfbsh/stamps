  Name: Thomas 'Old Tom' Parr Born
  Date: 1483 AD
  Description: |
    Thomas Parr was born at the Glyn in the township of Winnington within the chapelry of Great Wollaston (in the parish of Alberbury) in 1483.

    According to the plaque he lived in the reigns of ten Kings and Queens of England and died on the 13th November 1635, aged 152 years and 9 months.  He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

    A modern interpretation of the results of the autopsy suggests that Parr was probably less than 70 years of age.  It is possible that Parr's records were confused with those of his grandfather.

    The brass plaque is in the church at Great Wollaston.

  Name: John Benbow Born
  Date: 10th March 1653 AD
  Description: |
    Benbow joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned. Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War, serving on and later commanding several vessels. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against pirates and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession.

    Benbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral.  He was then involved in an incident during the action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture, including Treasure Island - the Admiral Benbow is the tavern where Jim Hawkins and his mother live.

    Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.
