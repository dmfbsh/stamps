      A single value featuring Ayrton Senna and the Williams FW16.<br>
      <br>
      For 1994, Senna finally signed with the Williams-Renault team after Prost had reluctantly decided to end his career.  Prost's contract clause forbidding Senna from joining Williams did not extend to 1994 and Prost retired with one year left on his contract, rather than face the prospect of a repeat of the animosities of 1989 and 1990.  Pre-season testing showed that the new Williams FW16 car had speed, but it was extremely difficult to control.  Senna himself had made numerous diplomatic comments that the FW16 had some quirks which needed to be ironed out due to the fact that, contractually, he was forbidden from outright criticising the car.  It was obvious that the FW16, after the regulation changes banning active suspension, traction control, power brakes, and ABS, exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and FW14B cars that had preceded it.  It was also the first season that Williams used power steering, a system which had been problematic.  Furthermore, the cockpit was too tight for Senna's frame, and several adjustments were subsequently made, including the lengthening of the steering column by 12 millimetres.  The surprise of testing was the Benetton team, whose car was more nimble than the Williams although less powerful. Senna prophetically commented, "It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen."

      A mini sheet of one value featuring a Jaguar F1 car.<br>
      <br>
      Jaguar Racing competed in the F1 World Championship from 2000 to 2004. It was formed from the purchase by Ford of Jackie Stewart's Stewart Grand Prix Formula One team in June 1999. Ford renamed the team Jaguar Racing as part of its global marketing operations to promote their Jaguar premium car company. Despite this branding, they continued to use Ford-Cosworth engines in the cars, no Jaguar engineering was involved. During the years of Ford's ownership, the team was unable to revive its performances of 1999 (4th in the Constructor's Championship).
