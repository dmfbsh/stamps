      Gilles Villeneuve drove in F1 from 1977 until his death in May 1982.  Villeneuve started driving for McLaren in 1977, but switched to Ferrari towards the end of that season.  Villeneuve remained with Ferrari for the rest of his F1 career.  He won six Grand Prix races in his F1 career.  In 1979 he finished second by four points in the championship to team-mate Jody Scheckter.<br>

      On May 8, 1982, Villeneuve died after an accident during the final qualifying session for the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder.  With eight minutes of the session left, Villeneuve came over the rise after the first chicane and caught Jochen Mass travelling much more slowly through the left-handed bend before the Terlamenbocht corner.  Mass saw Villeneuve approaching at high speed and moved to the right to let him through on the racing line.  At the same instant Villeneuve also moved right to pass the slower car.  The Ferrari hit the back of Mass' car and was launched into the air at a speed estimated at 120-140 mph.  It was airborne for over 100m before nosediving into the ground and disintegrating as it somersaulted along the edge of the track.  At the time of his death, Villeneuve was extremely popular with fans and has since become an iconic figure in the history of the sport.  His son, Jacques Villeneuve, became Formula One world champion in 1997 and to date is the only Canadian to win the Formula One World Championship.
