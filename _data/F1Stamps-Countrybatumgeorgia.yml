      A 2 stamp sheet showing Ayrton Senna and the Williams Renault FW16.<br>
      <br>
      Ayrton Senna started racing in F1 with Toleman in 1984, in 1985 he joined Lotus for three years.  Then in 1988 Senna joined the then-double world champion, Alain Prost, at McLaren - over the next 5 years there was a dramatic rivalry between the two drivers, which culminated in a number of dramatic race incidents (most famously, two championship deciding collisions at the 1989 and 1990 Japanese Grands Prix).  The dominant MP4/4 took Senna to his first world title in 1988.<br>

      In 1994 Senna signed for Williams - Williams had won the previous two world championships in superior cars.  In this year the FIA had banned electronic aids to make the sport more "human", the FW16 had speed but was difficult to drive.  Senna failed to finish the first two races of the season, but placed the FW16 on pole position for the San Marino Grand Prix, his 65th pole.  On 1st May 1994, Senna was leading the San Marino Grand Prix, when his FW16 left the track at the high speed Tamburello corner, hitting the concrete wall at 135mph.
