    Description: |
      The first motor races were held in the Belgian Ardennes in 1896, and from 1902 races on a closed part of the public roads were held - this is the first time public roads were used.  At this time, different layouts were used each year, the longest being 73.8 miles.<br>
      <br>
      The first circuit was designed in 1920 by Jules de Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem, the original triangle-shaped course used public roads between the Belgian towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy, and Stavelot.  The first car race was held in 1922 and the first Grand Prix in 1925.<br>

      Spa was a very fast circuit and it had a nasty reputation for being dangerous and very fast - it was a circuit known to be one for the brave, and most drivers were frightened of it.<br>
      <br>
      The original length of the circuit was 15km, the configuration of the circuit was changed many times over the years - the biggest change came in 1979 when the circuit was shortened from 14km to 7km.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit probably demonstrates the importance of driver skill more than any other in the world. This is largely due to the Eau Rouge and Blanchimont corners, both which need to be taken flat out to achieve a fast run onto the straights after them, which aids a driver in both a fast lap and in overtaking.
