  Description: |
    John the Baptist (c. 1st century BC - c. AD 30) was a mission preacher active in the area of Jordan River in the early 1st century AD.  He is also known as John the Forerunner in Christianity.
    
    John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement. Most Christian scholars agree that John baptized Jesus.
    
    According to the New Testament, John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas around AD 30 after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife Phasaelis and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I.
    
    Followers of John existed well into the 2nd century AD, and some proclaimed him to be the messiah.

  Description: |
    John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John.  Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, or John the Presbyter.

It had been believed that he was exiled (around AD 95) to the Aegean island of Patmos, where he wrote the Book of Revelation.

  Description: |
    Saint Lawrence or Laurence (31 December AD 225 - 10 August 258) was one of the seven deacons of the city of Rome under Pope Sixtus II who were martyred in the persecution of the Christians that the Roman Emperor Valerian ordered in 258.  Lawrence encountered the future Pope Sixtus II, who was of Greek origin and one of the most famous and highly esteemed teachers, in Caesaraugusta (today Zaragoza).  Eventually, both left Spain for Rome.  When Sixtus became the Pope in 257, he ordained Lawrence as a deacon, and though Lawrence was still young appointed him first among the seven deacons who served in the cathedral church.

- Saint: St Lucy
  Description: |
    Lucia of Syracuse (283 - 304), also called Saint Lucia or Saint Lucy, was a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution.  She is venerated as a saint in the Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches.  She is one of eight women (including the Virgin Mary) explicitly commemorated by Catholics in the Canon of the Mass.
    
    Lucia of Syracuse was honored in the Middle Ages and remained a well-known saint in early modern England.  She is one of the best known virgin martyrs, along with Agatha of Sicily, Agnes of Rome, Cecilia of Rome and Catherine of Alexandria.
    
    Lucy's Latin name Lucia shares a root  with the Latin word for light, lux.  A number of traditions incorporate symbolic meaning of St. Lucy as the bearer of light in the darkness of winter, her feast day being 13 December.  Because some versions of her story relate that her eyes were removed, either by herself or by her persecutors, she is the patron saint of the blind.

    She is mentioned by name twelve times in the canonical gospels, more than most of the apostles and more than any other woman in the gospels, other than Jesus's family.  Mary's epithet Magdalene may mean that she came from the town of Magdala, a fishing town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee in Roman Judea.

    Saint Nicholas of Myra (traditionally 15 March 270 - 6 December 343), also known as Nicholas of Bari, was an early Christian bishop of Greek descent from the maritime city of Myra in Asia Minor during the time of the Roman Empire.
    
    Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker.  Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries around Europe.
    
    His reputation evolved among the pious, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus ("Saint Nick") through Sinterklaas.

He is traditionally counted as the first bishop of Rome‍, or pope‍, and also as the first bishop of Antioch.  Based on contemporary historical data, his papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years; however, the length of his reign has never been verified.
