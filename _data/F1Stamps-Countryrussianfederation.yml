    Description: |
      A stamp commemorating the 2014 Russian Grand Prix.  The race marked the first time that the Russian Grand Prix had been held in a century, and was also the first time the Russian Grand Prix was run as a round of the F1 World Championship since the championship was formed in 1950.<br>

      Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes won the race after starting from pole position and leading every lap.  His team-mate Nico Rosberg finished second, after working his way up from the back of field after having to make an unscheduled pit stop on the first lap.  Williams' Valtteri Bottas completed the podium, having set the fastest lap - and a new lap record - on the final lap of the race.
