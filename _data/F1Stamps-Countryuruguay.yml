      The 1997 championship was decided under controversial circumstances as championship leader Michael Schumacher collided with Jacques Villeneuve whilst trying to defend his race lead in the final round of the championship (the European Grand prix, Jerez Spain).  Schumacher came to a halt in the gravel trap and was deemed at fault, his punishment was disqualification from the championship (gifting the title to Villeneuve).
