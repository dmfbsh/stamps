# List of Seasons in a Decade
- Year: 2020
  Description: |
    The 2020 season was due to the 71st season which would incorporate the 70th anniversary of F1 and the season was due to run over 22 races, however, the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 caused significant disruption to the season.<br>
    <br>
    After a delayed start to the season, 17 races took place.  The races were contested behind closed doors as fans were not permitted to attend due to the ongoing pandemic situation.  Some venues, such as Silverstone, held back to back races as races could not be held in many locations.<br>
    <br>
    The season will however be remembered as a record breaking year for Lewis Hamilton.  Hamilton won his seventh Drivers' Title (equalling Michael Schumacher's record), but also Hamilton became the most successful driver ever as he overtook Schumacher's win tally of 91.  Hamilton himself fell ill with Covid-19 and missed a race, making his achievement even more impressive.<br>
    <br>
    Also, this season F1 introduced the We Race as One campaign (an initiative to fight racism, global inequity and the impact of COVID-19) and there was growing global support for the Black Lives Matter movement,  Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.
