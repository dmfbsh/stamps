      Ayrton Senna commemoration.<br>
      <br>
      On 1st May 1994, Ayrton Senna's Williams FW16 left the track at the Tamburello corner on the seventh lap of the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola and collided with an unprotected concrete barrier. The crash itself was seemingly innocuous because, despite the telemetry later revealing that he was travelling at 193mph when he left the track, the collision itself appeared to be glancing and nobody was prepared for outcome that followed.<br>
      <br>
      Tens of thousands of Italian Formula 1 fans looked on, open mouthed and disbelieving as Professor Sid Watkins performed an emergency tracheotomy on the driver whom he later confessed was already beyond saving. Professor Watkins was later quoted as saying "He looked serene. I raised his eyelids and it was clear from his pupils that he had a massive brain injury. We lifted him from the cockpit and laid him on the ground. As we did, he sighed and, although I am totally agnostic, I felt his soul depart at that moment."<br>
      <br>
      Despite numerous conspiracy theories about what actually happened that day, it is generally accepted that the impact of the collision had caused one of the suspension beams to come adrift, piercing Senna's helmet and causing inter-cranial trauma just above his right eye. The incident followed a period of six laps where the drivers had been under the control of the safety-car and it was clear from the on-board camera on Michael Schumacher's Benetton that Senna's car was suffering from a notable loss of traction as the race restarted.

    Description: |
      Nelson Piquet competed in F1 from 1978 to 1991, he won the drivers championship three times in all, in 1981 and 1983 driving a Brabham (BT49C and BT52) for the Parmalat Racing Team and in 1987 driving the Williams FW11B.<br>
      <br>
      Piquet moved to Williams in 1986 which saw him becoming the team-mate of one of his fiercest rivals, Nigel Mansell.  Both were regarded as highly strung characters with delicate temperaments.  Two top drivers in the same team was a recipe for fireworks - and sure enough Mansell and Piquet went head to head for the title. Though the two drove the best cars on the grid, their rivalry caused each to deprive the other of points, allowing Alain Prost to win one of the closest and most fiercely disputed championships ever in F1.
