      The 1967 French Grand Prix, which was held at the Bugatti Circuit, Le Mans on July 2, 1967.   Graham Hill was on pole and led away for the first lap until Jack Brabham took over.  On lap 7 Jim Clark took the lead and Hill passed Brabham to make it a Lotus 1-2.  Hill then retook the lead until his crown-wheel and pinion failed on lap 14.  The same problem caused Clark's retirement from the lead on lap 23, leaving Brabham ahead of Dan Gurney, Chris Amon and Denny Hulme.  On lap 41 a fuel line broke on Gurney's car, making it a Brabham 1-2 and Amon's throttle cable broke several laps later.  Brabham drove home serenely to win his first race in eight Grands Prix and justify his position as reigning World Champion

      A mini sheet of four values commemorating Michael Schumacher's two drivers' titles of 1994 and 1995.<br>
      <br>
      The 1994 season was Schumacher's first Drivers' Championship.  The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Ayrton Senna (witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind in 2nd position) and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.<br>
      <br>
      In 1995 Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton.  He now had the same Renault engine as Williams.  He accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Damon Hill.  With team-mate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship and became the youngest two-time world champion in F1 history.
