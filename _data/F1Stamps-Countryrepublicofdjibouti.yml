      Nico Rosberg won the drivers' title after an intense season competing against team mate Lewis Hamilton in 2016.<br>
      <br>
      As of 2017, Rosberg is the only driver to win the championship apart from Sebastian Vettel and Hamilton since 2010.  He is also only the second son of a former champion, after Damon Hill, to have won the title himself, and the first to have achieved this feat while his father is alive, and in a car bearing the same racing number as his father's car (6).  He is also the first-ever German F1 driver to win a title in a German team with a German engine.<br>
      <br>
      Rosberg won the International Racing Driver Award at the 2016 Autosport Awards.  The award was first won by his father Keke in 1982.<br>
      <br>
      Rosberg announced his immediate retirement from F1 on 2 December 2016 at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony in Vienna.  The decision came after he reached the 'pinnacle' of his career after winning the 2016 World Drivers' Championship.  He was the first reigning champion to do so since Alain Prost in 1993.

      A mini sheet of one value featuring various F1 cars and the Malaysian Grand Prix.<br>
      <br>
      The Malaysian Grand Prix was part of the F1 World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit.  In 2017 it was announced that no further races would be held due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales (probably due to the races's appeal being damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street track in Singapore).
