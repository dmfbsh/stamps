      A 4 stamp sheet featuring Lewis Hamilton (and a BMW F1 Car!).<br>
      <br>
      It was announced prior to the start of the 2007 season that Lewis Hamilton would be partnering double World Champion Fernando Alonso.  On his debut at the Australian Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fourth and finished third in the race, becoming the thirteenth driver to finish on the podium in his first F1 career race.  In Bahrain, Hamilton got his first front-row start, qualifying and finishing second behind Felipe Massa.  Hamilton again finished second behind Massa in the Spanish Grand Prix, to take the lead in the drivers championship.  This meant that Hamilton broke Bruce McLaren's record of being the youngest driver to ever lead the world championship.<br>
      <br>
      Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco and afterwards suggested he was prevented from racing his team mate.  The FIA cleared McLaren following an investigation.  Hamilton had both his first pole position and first victory of his F1 career in the Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal.  He led for most of the race even after the safety car was deployed four times increasing the chances of him being overtaken.  A week later Hamilton won the United States Grand Prix, also from pole position, becoming the first Briton since John Watson in 1983 to win an F1 race in the US, and only the second person, after Jacques Villeneuve, to win more than one race in his rookie F1 season since the first year of the Championship.<br>
      <br>
      Following further race wins at the Hungarian and Japanese Grand Prix, Hamilton came second to the drivers championship to Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) by 1 point.  Hamilton had the same number of points as Alsono (109), but was classified ahead of Alonso.  McLaren would have won the constructors title, but were stripped of all of their points due to the espionage scandal between them and Ferrari.<br>
      <br>
      Ahead of the world championship finale in Brazil, Hamilton answered a question about what it would mean to him to become the first black champion, saying: "It will show that not only white people can do it, but also black people, Indians, Japanese and Chinese. It will be good to mean something."  Having made few public remarks about his ethnicity since becoming an F1 driver, Hamilton added: "Outside of Formula One my heroes are foremost my father, then Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King.  Being black is not a negative.  It's a positive, if anything, because I'm different.  In the future it can open doors to different cultures and that is what motor sport is trying to do anyway".
