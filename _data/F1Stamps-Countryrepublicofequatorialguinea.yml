      Johnny Herbert drove in F1 off and on from 1989 to 2000, starting out with Benetton and Tyrrell.  He then did a 4 year stint with Lotus, before moving back to Benetton via Ligier (for one race), after that Herbert moved to Sauber for 3 years, Stewart for 1 year and finally Jaguar for 1 year.  Herbert achieved only 3 race victories: 1995 British and Italian Grand Prix (Benetton) and 1999 European Grand Prix which was held at Nurburgring (Stewart).  During the mid-1980s, Johnny Herbert was widely regarded as a coming man of motor racing, comparable to the Scot Jim Clark.  Disaster struck in 1988, though, as Herbert, then a championship hopeful in International Formula 3000 was caught up in a major accident at Brands Hatch, badly breaking his legs in a fearsome impact with the barriers.  It was an act of huge bravery that saw him back in a racing car at the beginning of 1989, despite the fact he could barely walk.

      Ricardo Patrese drove for Williams from 1987 (just the final race, replacing the injured Mansell) to 1992; in that time he was runner up in 1992 and third place in 1989 and 1991 in the drivers championship.  Williams dominated F1 in 1992 and Patrese continued to deliver in his role of second driver to Nigel Mansell, moving out of the way for Mansell while leading comfortably at that year's French Grand Prix.  Patrese took a single win at the Japanese Grand Prix and had eight other podium finishes, including six second-place results.  With Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell all desperately trying to sign for Williams, Patrese's position looked to be under threat and he signed for Benetton before the end of the year.  Ironically, only Prost was able to agree terms with Williams for 1993, leaving a seat free for Patrese had he remained with the team.

      Jenson Button 'won' his race seat with Williams at the end of 1999; he drove for Williams in 2000, before moving to Benetton for 2001 and 2002 and then BAR Honda in 2003 (in 2007 this became the Honda team).  The elusive first win came at the Hungarian grand prix in 2006 in the wet.  At the end of 2008 Honda pulled out of F1 and the team became Brawn GP in 2009 following a management buyout - after years of having uncompetitive cars the Brawn BGP001 won 6 of the first 7 races and took Button to a well deserved drivers title and handed Brawn GP the constructors title.<br>

      Jacques Villeneuve won the drivers championship in 1997 in his second year in F1 (and his second year with Williams) in the FW19.  After a third year with Williams he moved to BAR for the next 5 years, but achieved little success.  In 2004 he drove a few races for Renault, before switching to Sauber for 2005 and 2006.<br>
      <br>
      Kimi Raikkonen drove for McLaren from 2002 to 2006; in that time he was runner up twice in the drivers championship.  Raikkonen is known to be very calm, cool, and calculating in his race strategy - prompting the nickname "Iceman", which is subtly written on the side of his current helmet design.  Raikkonen was always known to be extremely fast but his infamous technical failures did not bring the results that he deserved. Approximately 38% of his races during his 5 years with McLaren ended with retirement because of one technical failure or the other.<br>
      <br>
      David Coulthard drove for McLaren from 1996 to 2004; in that time he was runner up once and third place three times in the drivers championship.  Coulthard amassed a notable points haul placing him seventh on the all-time scorers list, being the top British scorer, in an F1 career spanning 15 seasons with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull Racing.<br>

      Michael Schumacher and Ferrari - enough said.
