      A mini sheet featuring Sebastian Vettel.<br>
      <br>
      Vettel started his F1 as a test driver for BMW Sauber and made his debut with the team at the 2007 USA Grand Prix replacing the injured Robert Kubica.  Later that season he joined Toro Rosso.<br>

      Vettel was quickly promoted to the Red Bull team in 2009 and finished that season as the youngest-ever World Drivers' Championship runner-up.  The following year he went on to become the youngest driver ever to win the World Drivers' Championship, aged 23.  This was then followed immediately with the same accolade for a double, triple and quadruple World Drivers' Champion.<br>

      Ending a long-term association with Red Bull, Vettel activated a clause to end his contract with Red Bull after the 2014 season and moved to Ferrari.
