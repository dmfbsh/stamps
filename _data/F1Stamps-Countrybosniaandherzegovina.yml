    Description: |
      A set of 4 values, showing the following Ferrari F1 cars:<br>
      <br>
      1954 625 F1 - in 1954, F1 regulations returned and the 625 was the Ferrari 500 chassis but with the now permitted 2.5litre engine, this car helped Jose Froilan Gonzalez and Mike Hawthorn to second and third places in the championship behind Juan Manuel Fangio in the Maserati<br>
      1970 312 B - driven by Jacky Ickx, Ignazio Giunti and Clay Regazzoni, Ferrari came second in the constructors championship behind the dominant Lotus<br>
      1978 312 T3 - driven by Carlos Reutemann and Gilles Villeneuve, the T3 featured the same flat 12 engine as previous 312's, but had an all new monocoque and suspension allowing improved air flow to the rear wing, the T3 was no match for the Lotus pioneering ground effect car and again came second in the constructors championship<br>
      1983 126 C3 - mandatory flat bottoms for the cars were introduced for 1983, reducing ground effect, and the 126C3 was designed with this in mind, Harvey Poslethwaite designed an over-sized but effective rear wing which clawed back around 50% of the lost downforce, whilst further compensation came from the engineers who boosted the power of the engine even further, this allowed Patrick Tambay and Rene Arnoux to take Ferrari to the constructors title
