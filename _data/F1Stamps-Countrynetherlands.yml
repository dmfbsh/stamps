      The race produced in a 1-2 result for the Ferraris of Rene Arnoux and Patrick Tambay, with John Watson third in a McLaren.  Derek Warwick's fourth-place finish resulted in the first points for both himself and the Toleman team.  The race was notable for a collision between the leader of the championship Alain Prost and the nearest challenger Nelson Piquet which immediately forced Piquet out of the race and caused Prost to retire shortly afterwards.  This was Rene Arnoux's 7th and last victory in F1.<br>

      The Dutch Grand Prix saw McLaren debut the new Porsche built TAG turbo V6 engine with Niki Lauda driving the new car and John Watson continuing with the Ford powered car.  After qualifying 19th Lauda's race ended on lap 25 with brake failure.  Watson's third place was the last time a naturally aspirated powered car would legally finish on a F1 podium until the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.  This would also prove to be the final time a McLaren used a naturally aspirated engine in a Grand Prix until the opening round of the 1989 season.
