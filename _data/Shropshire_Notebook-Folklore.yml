  Name: St Milburga's Well (Much Wenlock)
  Date: N/A
  Description: |
    There are two locations in Much Wenlock attributed as the site of St Milburga's Well, an ancient spring possessed with healing properties, and the ability to help young women find out whom their husband would be.

    The first site is off Barrow Street, near the Guildhall.  The other site is further to the south east on Barrow Street, near the bottom left of St Miburga Row, and is marked as "Whymperis Well".

    In 1913, all the wells were drained into the sewers.  Long term flooding problems in the town necessitated this action. The town sits within a bowl, which was prone to flooding. There are some taller chimneys in the town - illustrating the fact that the town used to put its fumes higher up to help escape the town's bowl.

  Name: Mitchell's Fold
  Date: Bronze Age
  Description: |
    The story of the Dun Cow is associated with Mitchell's Fold, in that according to traditional folklore Mitchell's Fold is where a giant kept a cow which gave unlimited amounts of milk. One day a witch milked the cow using a sieve until it had no more milk, as a result the cow fled to Warwickshire where it  became the Dun Cow. The witch was turned to stone and surrounded by other stones to prevent escape.

    Local folklore also suggests that Mitchell's Fold is the place where Arthur withdrew Excalibur from one of the stones.

  Name: The Stiperstones - The Devil's Chair
  Date: N/A
  Description: |
    It is said that when the mist descends on the rock formation Satan and a coven of witches are meeting to plan ill deeds.

    There are many legends of how the Devil's Chair came to be.  One suggests that the devil was carrying rocks to fill a nearby valley called "Hell's Gutter".  He sat the rocks down to rest but when he got up, the apron he was carrying the rocks in broke and so the devil left the rocks where they had fallen, cursing them.

    Another tells of a giantess who came collecting rocks and placing them in her apron.  The devil popped up and cut the apron strings causing the rocks to fall to the ground and the giantess ran away.  Since that day the devil returns to sit there and survey the world.
