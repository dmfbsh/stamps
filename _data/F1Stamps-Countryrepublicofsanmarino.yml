      A stamp issue to commemorate the 1983 San Marino Grand Prix.<br>
      <br>
      The San Marino Grand Prix was a F1 championship race which was run at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the town of Imola, near the Apennine mountains in Italy, between 1981 and 2006.  It is called the San Marino Grand Prix because there is already an Italian Grand Prix, and the republic of San Marino is itself too small to host a grand prix.  In 1980, the Imola track was used for the 51st Italian Grand Prix.<br>
      <br>
      The 1983 race was won by Patrick Tambay (Ferrari), Alain Prost (Renault) was second and in third pace was Rene Arnoux (Ferrari).
