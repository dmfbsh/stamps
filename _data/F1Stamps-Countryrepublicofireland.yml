      Jordan Grand Prix was a Formula One constructor that competed from 1991 to 2005.  The team is named after Irish businessman and founder Eddie Jordan.  Jordan and his team were well known for a 'rock and roll' attitude which added colour and character to Formula One in the 1990s.  In 1998, the team made its biggest signing, former World Champion Damon Hill, a graduate of Jordan's F3000 programme.  This stamp celebrates Jordan's finest race result; at the 1998 rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix in which only six cars finished, Damon Hill earned Jordan their first ever Formula One win, which was also Hill's 22nd career Grand Prix victory. Ralf Schumacher sweetened the victory by finishing second. In 1998, Hill finished 6th in the driver's standings with Ralf 10th.
