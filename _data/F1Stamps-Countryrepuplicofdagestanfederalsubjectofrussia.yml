      A mini sheet of one value featuring the Ferrari F1/87.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1987 season, the car was driven by Michele Alboreto (number 27) and Gerhard Berger (number 28) and replaced the Ferrari F1/86 used in 1986.  Gustav Brunner designed the car with assistance from John Barnard.  The F1/87 featured a six speed gearbox and a turbo charged 1.5 litre V6 engine.  Gerhard Berger scored two victories in the F1/87 at the 1987 Japanese Grand Prix and 1987 Australian Grand Prix and three pole positions.  The car demonstrated flashes of its potential early in the season with Alboreto for a short time leading the San Marino Grand Prix.  However, reliability issues were a major concern.  From the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, Ferrari looked to have a car as quick as any of their rivals.  Berger challenged Mansell for the lead at the Hungarian Grand Prix before being forced to retire.  The Austrian also came within a whisker of winning the Portuguese Grand Prix before spinning and the Mexican Grand Prix which he was leading before reliability issues forced him out once again.  The season finished on a high with dominating victories for Berger in the final two rounds and Alboreto made it a Ferrari 1-2 in Adelaide after Senna's disqualification.  Ferrari went into 1988 as one of the favourites for the championship.
