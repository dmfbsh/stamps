      In 1952, a number of entrants used various Ferrari chassis - the 500, 375, 212, 125 and 166.  The most popular was the 500.  In 1952, the championship was run for Formula 2 specifications.  Ferrari were the only team to have a car specifically designed for the new formula.  The car was powered by a in line four cylinder engine which was mounted behind the front axle, improving weight distribution.  Alberto Ascari won 9 straight races in the 500, a world championship record which still stands today.  The 500 won all but one race it was entered in, making it the second most statistically successful car in the history of the FIA world championship, after McLaren MP4/4 which failed to win only one of its 16 races.<br>

      In 2008, Ferrari competed the F1 season with the F2008.  It featured a new standard Electronic Control Unit (ECU), produced by McLaren Electronic Systems.  This was included to comply with the new regulations.  The ECU also removed most of the driver aids used in previous seasons, including traction control, engine braking and electronically assisted starting system.  It also made the management of the differential, engine and gear changes easier.  The car also weighed more than the previous season's F2007 chassis due to rule changes which included the gearbox which had to be used for four consecutive races and higher side protection around the drivers helmet.  The F2008 won 8 races of the season giving Ferrari the constructors title.
