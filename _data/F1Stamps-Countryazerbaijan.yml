      <br>
      The race was subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government.  In response, Red Bull Racing and Mercedes team principals Christian Horner and Toto Wolff sought to distance the sport from political issues.<br>
      <br>
      The organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written an open letter to him to which Ecclestone had not replied.  Sport for Rights made it clear that they did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public.
