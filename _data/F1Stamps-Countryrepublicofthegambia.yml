      A mini sheet of values featuring the following Ferrari F1 cars:<br>
      <br>
      - F150 - 2011, driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 3rd - the car's chassis designation was chosen to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification, although this has been seen by some pundits as a political move by Luca di Montezemolo following criticism for Ferrari's failure to secure the 2010 World Championship at the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.  In February 2011, Ford declared its intention to sue Ferrari over the use of the F150 name, to which Ford owns a trademark.  In response, Ferrari began to refer to the car as the "F150th Italia", claiming the original F150 moniker was simply an abbreviation.<br>
      - F10 - 2010, driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 3rd<br>
      - F60 - 2009, driven by Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 4th - the car was named F60 to celebrate the fact that 2009 is Ferrari's 60th year in Formula One, the only team to have competed every year.<br>
      - F2008 - 2009, driven by Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa, constructors' championship: 1st
