  Name: St Mary, Acton Burnell
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1275 AD
  Description: |
    This church is considered to be the finest Early English (13th Century) church in Shropshire.  Unlike most English parish churches, Acton Burnell is built in a same style throughout.

    It features a corbel-table with many grotesque carvings (a corbel-table is a continuous row of corbels, and a corbel is a block of stone projecting from a wall and supporting some heavy feature).

    The font is considered to be the finest Early English font in Shropshire.  In the south wall of the chancel is a double piscina.  In the north transept are medieval encaustic tiles and some impressive monuments.  The tomb chest is to Sir Nicholas Burnell (died 1382), on it is what is considered to be the finest memorial brass in Shropshire.  The other large monuments are to Sir Richard Lee (died 1591) and Sir Humphrey Lee (died 1632).

    Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and this estate belonged to Robert Burnell an English bishop who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292.

  Name: St Margaret, Acton Scott
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th to 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    This is a church that has suffered at the hands of 19th Century restorers.  Much of the masonry is medieval, but the windows were all renewed in the 19th Century.  The porch was added in 1722 and the north chapel in 1820.

    Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and the 'Scott' originates from the medieval name Reynold le. Scot who held a share in the manor in 1255.

    The settlement was registered as Actune in the Domesday Book.

  Name: St Peter, Adderley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1635-1636 AD
  Description: |
    The oldest existing part of the present church is the north transept, which was built in 1635-36 as a burial chapel for the Needham family, the Viscounts Kilmorey of Shavington.  Sir Robert Needham was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire by 1596, a deputy lieutenant of the county in 1600 and High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1606-07.  He was a member of the Council in the Marches of Wales in 1609 and vice-president of the council in 1614.  He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Shropshire in 1593 and 1604 and was created Viscount Kilmorey in 1625.

    The other remaining part of the older church is the tower, built in 1712.  The rest of the church was built in 1801 by Richard Baker; it is the only known work by this architect.  The chancel was restored in 1822.  The interior of the church was separated into two parts in circa 1970 (although the church records show this as having taken place in 1956) so that the nave could continue as the parish church and rest preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust.

    The church is constructed in yellow-grey sandstone, with some red sandstone in the tower.

    The cast iron window frames were made locally at Coalbrookdale, and for this reason the church is Grade I listed.

    At the entrance to the north transept the carved wooden screen dates from circa 1637.  The font is Norman and is thought it may be a piece of stone taken from Wroxeter (upside column?).  The hexagonal pulpit dates from 1801.  The stained glass consists of 12 heraldic panels containing the Needham family arms.  The brass in the floor dates from circa 1390, it is thought that the head was removed in the Civil War.  The other brass commemorates Sir Robert Needham who died in 1556 and his wife who died in 1560.  This brass was lifted in circa 1970 and was found to be a 'palimpsest', i.e. an earlier brass (probably 14th Century and Flemish in origin), which had been cut up and reused.

    The mounting block of four sandstone steps dates from 1774.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning 'Ealdthryth's wood/clearing', a leah (Old English) is a forest, wood, glade or clearing; (later) a pasture or a meadow.

  Name: St Michael, Alberbury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1290 AD
  Description: |
    The church is thought to have been founded between the 7th and 10th Centuries.  It was originally a Minster Church (Minster was the Anglo-Saxon version of a monastery, and was originally applied to churches served by monks / clergy living a communal life and endowed by a charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer, but was not the seat of a bishop and the church had no diocesan responsibilities).

    In the mid-12th century the church was given Shrewsbury Abbey, but was later assigned to Alberbury Priory.  The priory was founded in 1228 and was one of three dependencies of the French abbey of Grandmont (the priory itself was sited about one and a quarter miles away by the river Severn).  Being an 'alien' priory it was vulnerable to predators representing the king, the priory was finally suppressed by the king in 1441 and the estate passed to All Souls' college, Oxford.

    The church was reconsecrated in 1290, following the cessation of a long-running series of Welsh border disputes.

    The tower is Early English (approx. 1180 to 1270), it has a saddleback roof (a ridge and two sloping sides) - the only example of such in Shropshire.

    The roof of the nave is thought to be one of the finest in the county.

    The Loton Chapel was added in 1320, and contains a pre-Raphaelite window by Burne Jones.

    There are two wall-monuments to Sir Richard Lyster, who was MP for Shrewsbury in the 18th Century, the imagery on one refers to a scene in the House of Commons when he protested against a decision of the House.

    The place name derives from the Old English 'burh' (a fortified place) and the personal name Aluburg or Ealhburg.

  Name: St Andrew, Ashford Bowdler
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The present building dates from Norman times - there are blocked Norman doorways in the south and north side of the aisle, there are also Norman windows in the chancel.  Originally it was a dependent chapelry of Bromfield Priory.

    Beneath the bell turret are two benefactions boards.

    There are several monuments, the most interesting of which is that to Jonathan Green (died 1792), consisting of two urns in front of an obelisk (it is the work of Williams Humphries Stephens of Worcester).

    The church is very close to the river Teme, in fact the chancel collapsed during reconstruction in 1904-1907.

    The name of the settlement means 'Ash-tree ford'.  Henri de Boulers was a tenant 1211-2.  Aesc is the Anglian for an ash tree, ford is Old English (meaning a ford).

  Name: St Mary, Ashford Carbonell
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Although of 12th Century origin, the church did not become a separate parish until 1880, prior to that it was a perpetual curacy of Little Hereford.  The original 12th Century building was smaller than the present one, the chancel was extended to the east and the nave to the west probably in the 13th Century.  This was revealed during the restoration of 1882-83, as the original foundations were shallower (only one foot); also, behind the plaster there was different masonry.

    The oak belfry was added in the 15th Century.  The gallery was added in the 18th Century.  The parish chest probably dates from this time.  The unusual arrangement of windows, which includes a Vesica windows, was restored in the 19th Century.  The vesica piscis (literally fish's bladder) had the same meaning for the early Church as the symbol of the fish, the Greek word for fish is ichthus and is composed of the initial letters of the Greek for 'Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour'.  A vesica window is rare in English parish churches, during the restoration two Norman windows were revealed and above them the stones which were part of the ancient vesica window.

    The carved ends of the oak benches are all different and replaced the box pews.

    There is a yew tree which is certified as being 1500 years old (the certificate from 1989 is signed by David Bellamy, naturalist; Allen Meredith, Arboriculturist; Robert Hardy, Longbow enthusiast; and Robert Runcie, the then Archbishop of Canterbury), this suggests that there was an earlier structure here either Saxon or even pre-Christian.

    The name of the settlement means 'Ash-tree ford'.  It was held by John Carbonel in 1221.  Aesc is the Anglian for an ash tree, ford is Old English (meaning a ford).

  Name: St Mary, Astley
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    From the time of the Anglo-Saxons until 1860 the Church was a chapel to the Collegiate Church of St Mary in Shrewsbury.  At the time of the Domesday survey a priest is mentioned, indicating the existence of a church building.  The earliest part of the present building dates from about 100 years after the Domesday survey.

    The tower was built in 1837.

    The church was restored in 1883.

    The rood screen, altar and reredos date from the 1930s when the chancel was re-organised.

    The church is notable as it has a bell dating from 1270, which is thought to have been cast in the churchyard by a travelling founder.  The bell was rehung in 2012 after being restored.  It is thought to be one of, if not the, oldest bells in the county and the diocese.

    The name of the village in old English means 'east wood or clearing' (east and leah) and this is in relation to Albrighton.

  Name: St Calixtus, Astley Abbots
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1138 AD
  Description: |
    The church was consecrated on 14th October in 1138 AD by the Bishop of Hereford, it is mainly Norman with Anglo-Saxon roots.  There is Roman tufa stone in the walls.

    The tower and west front were built in 1857.  The north wall of the nave is Norman.  The south wall of the nave is Victorian.  The chancel is dated 1633 (the date being on the east gable).  It is notable that the window tracery is Decorated not Perpendicular.

    The chancel’s hammer beam roof rests on corbels carved with a lion, a unicorn, a phoenix and a Pegasus.  The panelling is 17th Century.   The pulpit is dated 1633.

    In the east window is a small panel of stained glass from the early 13th Century, it shows a figure of Christ under a canopy - thought to be one of the earliest appearances of a canopy in stained glass.

    The church also houses a maiden's garland (a heart shaped wooden frame decorated with gloves, cloth and ribbons).  The one at Astley Abbotts has a ribbon-like piece of paper saying, in still legible handwriting, that it commemorates a young woman, Hannah Phillips, who drowned in the river Severn shortly before her wedding.

    The font is lead lined and possibly medieval.

    In the churchyard is a memorial known as the lion grave to John Phillips, a surgeon.  There are many stories about this grave, the most popular being that he was mauled to death by a lion that escaped from the circus (and they are buried together).  Alternatively, he had ideas above his station and took the lion as his heraldic symbol.

    The name of settlement is from the Old English for 'East wood/clearing', in relation to Morville.  It was held by the abbots of Shrewsbury Abbey.

  Date: 1132 AD
  Description: |
    The original Deed reads: Know all men who are and who shall be, that on the day of dedication of the church of Eston, I Robert, son of Aherius, gave to God and the Chapel of the same vill of Eston one virgate of land containing sixty acres and the whole tithe of my demesne of the same vill and one manse for the health of my soul and all my predecessors and successors.  And that my be gift be free and equit of all reclaim by me and by my heirs and may ever remain firm and stable, I have corroborated it with present writing and the impression of my seal.

    Witnesses to the Deed include the Bishop of Herefore, the Prior of Wenlock and the Lord of the Manor of Upton Cressett.

    The Tympanum is considered one of the best examples of early Norman sculpture in the county.  It is of Christ's entry into Jerusalem, and is thought to be of the Hereford School.

    The oak door and ironwork dates from around 1636.  The three east windows were added in the second half of the 19th Century.  The pulpit is thought to be Jacobean.

    It is unclear whether the Chancel arch is Norman or Transitional and the panelling in the Chancel may be from the Elizabethan or Georgian period.

    There are no graves at the church becase after Robert Fitz Aer died, his hier is known to have been in dispute with the monks of Shrewsbury Abbey (who owned the priory at Morville), over the right to bury the men of Eston in their own village.  The Abbot of Salop decided in favour of the Abbey.

    The name of the settlemt derives from the Old English for 'East farm/settlement' (east and tun).  It was held by Robert son of Aer (Fitz Aer) in 1212.  Previously, the village was distinguished by the affix Wheaten, meaning 'growing with wheat'.

  Name: St Eata, Atcham
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: Before 1075 AD
  Description: |
    This is the only church in England dedicated to St Eata of Hexham.

    The first church to St Eata is said to have been built in the 8th Century but there is no longer any trace of this.  The present church has been on this site since at least 1075, this is known because the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (a Benedictine monk who wrote one of the great chronicles of 11th and 12th Century England) was baptised at the church on Easter Day in 1075.

    The oldest part of the present church is the nave which dates from the late Saxon or early Norman period.  The tower is probably late 12th Century, the chancel late 13th Century and the south porch is dated 1665.  The church was restored in the late 19th Century.

    The church is constructed from red and grey sandstone and incorporates some large blocks from the Roman city of Wroxeter.

    The name Atcham is a contraction of Attingham, meaning 'the home of Eata's people'.

  Name: St Giles, Barrow
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 11th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church was originally built as a chapel to Wenlock Abbey.  The date of origin of its chancel is uncertain; it has been suggested that this was as early as the 8th century, but it is more likely that it originated in the 11th century.  The Norman nave dates from about 1100, and probably replaced an earlier timber nave.  The lower parts of the tower date from later in the 12th century.  A brick south porch was built in 1705, and the brick top stage of the tower and its pyramidal roof were added during the 18th century.  The church was restored in 1851-52 and in 1894-95 the north chapel was built to replace a chapel dating from 1688.

    The font is likely to be 12th Century.  The chancel arch is Anglo-Saxon in origin, but it was altered during the restoration.  The church also has a rare ornamental tympanum.

    The name of the settlement is from the Old English bearu meaning a a grove (a wood of limited extent).

  Name: All Saints, Baschurch
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    Some parts of the church are Norman (and date from the 12th Century).  The bottom four stages of the tower were constructed in the early 13th Century.  The top stage was added in circa 1400.

    The church was restored in 1790 by Thomas Telford.  Further restorations were carried out in the late 19th Century.

    The font dates from 1681, and there are monuments to Thomas Corbet, dated 1615, and Thomas Slaney M.P. for Shrewsbury, who served in eight parliaments.  There is also is an old chained Bible, given in 1770 by the Rev. Robert Jeffreys, vicar here for 58 years, who died in 1800.

    The stained glass in the east window is by Kempe (1886).

    The English name Baschurch first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Bascherche, but the earliest references to Baschurch are under its Welsh name Eglwyssau Bassa (Churches of Bassa), in a seven-stanza englyn-poem of the same name found in the Welsh cycle of poems called Canu Heledd, generally thought to date to the ninth century.

  Name: St Mary Magdalene, Battlefield
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1406 AD
  Description: |
    The church was built just after the Battle of Shrewsbury as a chantry - a place of intercession and commemoration for those killed in the fighting.  The building is probably constructed over a mass burial pit as it is thought that some of the battle was fought at the place now known as Battlefield.

    The church was originally a collegiate church, the main duty of the community was to perform a daily liturgy for the dead.  The college and chantry were dissolved in 1548 and the building was used as a parish church.  The building, however, deteriorated and became unused, it has been subject to various restorations.

  Name: St Bartholomew, Benthall
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1667 AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday Book, the settlement was most likely part of the manor at Much Wenlock.  During the Middle Ages, there was a chapel at Benthall which was dedicated to St Brice, and which was dependent on Wenlock Priory.

    The chapel was destroyed in the Civil War and the present church was built to replace it.  The church is considered to be a fine example of a restoration era (the post Civil War Stuart period) church. The church was extended in the late 19th Century.

    There is a vertical sun dial on the church with an eye constructed of glass tesserae.

    St Bartholomew was the patron saint of bees.  At one time a bee hive was kept in the church, the honey was sold or given away to help the poor of the community.  The bees used to access the hive through the mouth of the lion's head carving which is just beneath the sun dial.

    The place-name means 'nook of land where the bent-grass grows', this derives from the Old English 'beonet' whicn means bent-grass and 'halh' (Anglian) which means a nook of land, a small valley, dry ground in marsh, or a piece of land projecting from, or detached from, the main area of its administrative unit.

  Name: St Mary, Billingsley
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1140 AD
  Description: |
    The church was build in around 1140 AD in the reign of King Stephen and was restored in 1875 by G E Street.  The original Norman doorway was blocked in the 14th Century, and a new door was built along with the timber framed porch (which is considered to be one of the finest medieval porches in the county).  There are also some glazed floor tiles fron circa 1500.

    The pulpit is Jacobean and unusual in that it is a double pulpit.  The font is largely original Norman stonework.  The church has an Easter Sepulchre dating from around 1320 (the only church is Shropshire with this feature).

    The bellcote houses two bells, the north bell dates from the fourteenth century.  The south bell is inscribed ‘God Save The Queen A. R. 1707’.

    In the churchyard are two ancient (ones with a girth of over 20ft) yew trees, one male and one female.

    Billingsley in Shropshire is the only village in the Country with that name.  Billingsley was an important mining and industrial centre from the time of the Napoleonic Wars until the early twentieth century.

    The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, Billing may refer to the Old English for a hill (or ridge) or a personal name.  Leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Bishops Castle
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    Bishop's Castle is named from the castle built there by the Bishop of Hereford in circa 1127.

    The original church was built towards the end of the 13th century to serve the medieval town controlled by the Bishops of Hereford.  Only the tower remains of the original church (but this was rebuilt in 1648 after the church was badly damaged in 1645 during the Civil War).  The rest of the church was completely re-built in 1869-60 by Thomas Nicholson in the Victorian Gothic style.

    During the rebuild, an Early English (1180-1275) doorway was removed and is now in the wall of the vicarage garden.  Also from the old church are a plain Norman font and a demi-figure of an Elizabethan divine (now upright).  Some of the stained glass is Pre-Raphaelite, other windows are considered fine examples of Victorian glass and are by Powell's, O'Connor and Henry Holiday.

  Name: St Leonard, Bridgnorth
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Although not mentioned in the Domesday book, there is Anglo-Saxon and Norman stonework in the fabric of the church and so it is likely that an earlier church stood on the site of the present church.

    During the Civil War the Parliamentarians used the church to store ammunition, this was ignited by a cannon shot - the north aisle and part of the south aisle were destroyed.  The roof and nave were rebuilt in 1662, but the church was not fully restored until 1860.

  Name: St Mary Magdalene, Bridgnorth
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1792 - 1795 AD
  Description: |
    In 1086 AD Roger de Montgomery founded a collegiate church at Quatford which was transferred to Bridgnorth in 1101 AD.  A Castle was built and the first church of St Mary Magdalene was the chapel of the castle.  A later medieval church was built, but by the late 18th Century this church was in a state of disrepair.  Thomas Telford (who had correctly predicted the collapse of St Chad's) examined the church and advised that it be completely rebuilt.

    Telford was commissioned to design the new church.

    It is aligned north-south, rather than the more usual west-east.

    The name of the town derives from the Old English brycg (a bridge or causeway) and noro (northern or north).

  Name: St Mary the Virgin, Bromfield
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Anglo- Saxon / Norman
  Description: |
    In Anglo-Saxon times Bromfield was an important collegiate church with 12 canons.  In circa 1060 Edward the Confessor issued a writ to the canons granting extensive liberties.  It was described as being a wealthy minster of royal foundation.  

    The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and Bromfield is described as a holding of St Mary's, Shrewsbury.

    During the early 12th Century the canons were gradually replaced by monks and a Benedictine priory was established in 1155 AD (Henry II granted the charter); the priory was subject to the abbey in Gloucester.

    The priory took over part of the existing parish church, which had been rebuilt in the 12th Century with a cruciform plan, possibly with a tower at the crossing.  At some point the tower and the north transept disappeared, possibly following the fall of the tower.  The present tower is 13th Century.

    The priory was dissolved in 1540 AD and the buildings were taken over by Charles Foxe - he incorporated the present chancel (the former crossing) into his residence and it was divided into two stories.  The south transept was converted to form the rest of the house.  There are still parts of the Tudor residence in the grounds of the present church.

    In the 17th Century the house was damaged by fire and the occupants moved away.  The church was restored for worship in 1658 AD.

    The church was further restored in 1889-90 by Hodgson Fowler (a prolific ecclesiastical architect of the Victorian era) who also designed the triptych behind the altar.

    The oldest feature in the church is the Norman chancel arch.

    The chancel has a Baroque painted ceiling by Cheshire artist Thomas Francis (1672).  On the south wall of the nave is the Royal Coat of Arms of Charles II - one the largest in existence.  Most of the stained glass is by Kempe (a renowned designer and manufacturer of stained glass in the Victorian era).  The Saints featured in the west window are all female, which in unusual.

    The name of the settlement means 'broomy' open land (brom is the Old English for Broom (a thorny bush or shrub) and feld is the Old English open country or unencumbered ground.

  Name: All Saints, Broseley
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1845 AD
  Description: |
    This church is considered to be the finest early Victorian church in the county, and is constructed throughout in an authentic Perpendicular style.  It is built of stone from Grinshill.

    In the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, the wooded parish of Broseley expanded as the coal-mining industry grew, there was further expansion in the 18th Century with increasing industry in the area.  This made the existing church unsuitable for the increasing population.

    In the early 1700's, what was probably the original medieval church, was completely rebuilt and finished in 1716.  The present church then replaced this building.  When the new church was consecrated the dedication was changed from St Leonard to All Saints.

    The church contains a window by Kempe.

    A settlement existed at Broseley in 1086 and is listed as Bosle in the Domesday Book.  The name of the town likely derives from either the Old English for town's guardian (burh-weard) or the Old English personal name Burgweard, and the Old English leah meaning a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).

  Name: Holy Trinity, Buildwas
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1720 AD
  Description: |
    The name Buildwas may derive its name from the Saxon words 'beild' or 'belde' (a shelter). and 'was' (water), surrounded as it is on three sides by hills and on the fourth by the river Severn.  Another view is that the name is from the Old English 'waesse' which means 'swamp' or 'marsh' and is usually translated as 'land by a meanering river which floods and drains quickly'.

    The village of Buildwas has been recognised since 1086 as the first reference to it was made in the Domesday Book.

    There has been a church on the present site since medieval times, the present church dates from 1720.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1864, a painting from 1790 shows a shorter western turret with a flatter pyramid top - the present timber-framed belfry probably also dates from 1864.

    Within the church are memorial tablets to members of two local families who were closely linked to the Industrial Revolution, including the Smithemans, who owned the site of Abraham Darby's first furnace in Coalbrookdale.  The pulpit is a fine Jacobean example.  The east window dates from 1864 and depicts scenes from the life of Christ.

    In the churchyard, there are some unusual cast iron headstones and tombstones, which were cast locally.

  Name: St Mary, Burford
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The Domesday Book records the presence of a church with two priests which is unusual.

    The church comprises a mixture of medieval and Victorian elements; the chancel is 12th Century the nave and tower are later and date from the 14th Century.  In 1889-90 the church was extensively restored by Sir Aston Webb, an English architect who designed the principal facade of Buckingham Palace and the main building of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

    There is some good stained glass by Powell.  By the south door is a medieval water stoup.  The parish chest is medieval.  The rood screen is Victorian and was made in Louvain (Leuven, Belgium).  The are other good Victorian fittings - the pulpit, lectern, chandeliers and the chancel roof (all by Webb, an early believer in the arts and crafts style).  The reredos is mahogany.

    There are a number of notable memorials dating from the 14th to the 19th Century.  The Cornwall family were lords of Burford for 400 years from the mid-14th Century (the castle was on the site of the present day Burford House).  The brass monument in the floor is c. 1370 to Dame Elizabeth Cornewayle.  The tomb recess (14th Century) contains an alabaster effigy of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of John of Gaunt, who died in 1426.  There is an unusual heart tomb commemorating Edmond Cornwall who died in 1436 - he directed that his heart should be enclosed in lead and buried in the church.  In the centre of the chancel is a rare oaken effigy to another Edmond Cornwall who died in 1508.  The monuments high on the chancel wall are dated 1630.

    The triptych on the north wall (not open when we visited), is a huge Elizabethan piece, painted by Melchior Salabuss and dated 1588 (the year of the Armada).

    The name of the settlement derives from the Old English for a fortified place (burh) by a ford.

  Name: St Michael, Cardeston
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1276 AD
  Description: |
    The church is known to have existed prior to 1276, as there is one window in the chancel in the present building from before that date.  By the 18th Century, the medieval church was in a poor state of repair and it was replaced by a new building in 1749, the building was significantly remodelled in 1844.  The church needed further restoration in 1905.

    The church is notable for its unusual tower (which was added in 1844) as the square lower stage becomes octagonal above angle broaches.  The architect of the tower, vestry and new windows in the nave was Thomas Jones of Chester who had been employed by the Leightons at Loton Park and in Alberbury church.  Three designs were were proposed, a square tower, a spire and a square base with an octagonal tower.  In medieval times, an octagon was considered to be halfway between a circle (God) and a square (the Earth).  It was the place where heaven and earth came into contact.  This is why pulpits and fonts are often octagonal in shape.

    To fund the building of a tower, 500 pounds was donated by Lady Leighton from the proceeds of her published engraved picture of The Ladies of Llangollen.  The engraved picture was based on a sketch by Mary Parker a friend of The Ladies of Llangollen who often visited and secretly drew their portraits as they were unwilling to have their portraits taken formally.

    The village name means Card's farm/settlement (Card being a personal name).

  Name: St James, Cardington
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The presence of a church on the site is recorded in the Domesday Book.  In 1167, the village, including the church, was given to the Knights Templar (and was known as Templars' Cardington, allowing the people to share the privileges of the Knights).  It remained in their possession until 1308 (when the order was supressed).  The Knights were responsible for starting the building of the present church in the later part of the 12th Century.  During the following century the chancel was rebuilt and extended, and the tower was added.  Further additions and alterations were made during the following three centuries, followed by the porch in 1639.

    The body of the church is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and has tiled roofs.  The south doorway contains a door dated 1648.

    In the churchyard is a sandstone sundial dating from the middle of the 18th Century.

    In the Domesday Book the village is referred to as 'Cardintine under the Fief of Rainwald Vicecomes' and it is mentioned that there were 11 leagues of woodland.  The name 'Cardington' derives from an English chief and warrior named Carda, whose sons and followers were called the Cardinga.  They made their home where the village is, and the village they built became known as Cardington, or the town of the sons of Carda.

    In the church is a large monument to Chief Justice of Leighton of Plaish (died 1607), this Jacobean monument is the earliest in Shropshire which depicts the deceased lying on his side. 

    Judge Leighton was known as 'the hanging judge' (as was Judge Jeffries) as he condemned so many people to be hanged.  Amongst those condemned by Leighton was a local builder, who had come to the judge to ask to be pardoned for his crime.  The Judge promised him that if he would build him the finest set of chimneys he had ever yet built he would spare his life.  The builder did construct the chimneys (on Plaish Hall).  But after completing the job the Judge ordered the mans' eyes to be put out, and for him to be hanged from the same chimneys he had just built (so that he could build no more chimneys ever finer).  It is said that one can see the rope with which the builder was hanged.

  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    Although there is evidence of a Norman church existing on the site, the present church dates from the 14th Century (probably completed by 1345).  The lower part of the tower is from this time too, the upper part of the brick tower dates from the early 18th Century (cira 1720).  The south porch was built in 1887 by J Farmer of Newport.

    The stained glass in the east window is dated 1892, it was designed by Kempe, and depicts the Crucifixion.  In the south window of the chancel is glass by Burlison and Grylls, dating from about 1888, and depicting the Parable of the Sower. 

    The pulpit is partly Jacobean and the font is Norman.

    The carvings on the oak structures in the Chancel and Sanctuary completed between 1887 - 1899 by local boys taught by the vicar.

    There is a ring of six bells, all of which were cast in 1720 by Abraham Rudhall II of Gloucester.

    The place name is thought to derive from the Old English Cegel, meaning pole, as it is believed that the marsh may have been marked out by posts.

  Name: St Swithin, Cheswardine
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The oldest part of the church is the chancel which is Early English (1180 to 1275).  As part of the rebuild of the church in 1886, it was moved stone by stone 13 feet further east.

    The tower was added in the late 15th Century.

    The medieval church was falling into disrepair by the 18th Century and was replaced in 1808.  This building was in turn replaced in 1887 by the present church.

    The church is noted for the roof in the chancel chapel.  Some of the stained glass is by Kempe.  There are also some Minton tiles in the chancel.

    The church contains a facsimilie reproduction of four pages (out of twelve) inscribed on velum of a 12th Century Breviary which is in the possession of the church (as the church was served by Haughmond Abbey, it is not improbable that the original was written there).

    The church also has a Sanctus Bell which was probably used in the church prior to the reformation.

    The name Cheswardine, recorded in 1086 as Ciseworde, in 1189 as Chesewordin and about 1650 as Cheswardyne, is probably derived from the Old English for 'cheese-producing settlement' or 'cheese farm'.

  Name: St Michael, Childs Ercall
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The nave is the oldest part of the church, but its date is unknown, thought to be 13th Century.  The arcades were added in the 13th Century (the south is circa 1200 and the north circa 1250).  The south aisle was rebuilt in the 14th Century.  The tower dates from circa 1500.

    The north aisle and chancel were rebuilt in 1879.  The porch was also added in 1879.

    The font is medieval.  The organ is considered to be a fine example of one by Nicolson and Lord (circa. 1880).  The Treble Bell dates from c. 1700, the second bell is by William Blews (Birmingham) from c. 1868, and the Tenor Bell is by John Clibury (Wellington) from 1590 (it is known as an 'Alphabet' bell).

    The name of the settlement is possibly an old district name, from 'gravel' and 'bare', either originally applied to the site of High Ercall or to the hill known as The Ercall ('Ear' (Old English) Gravel, mud, earth and calu (Old English) bald, bare, lacking vegetation).  The affix 'child' may refer to a younger member of the Strange family who once held the manor.

  Name: St Michael the Archangel, Chirbury
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    An Anglo-Saxon church was founded circa 915 when a fort was built on the site.  The current building dates from the 12th Century.  The aisles and arcades were added in the 13th Century - the arcades noticeably lean outwards.  The tower was constructed around 1300 and the chancel was added in 1733.  The church was restored in 1871-72.  The tower and body of the church were constructed using limestone rubble with pink sandstone ashlar dressings and slate roofs.  The chancel is red brick with a tiled roof.

    In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the place name was recorded as Cyricbyrig.  Later in 1086 in the Domesday book, the place name was recorded as Cireberie which means 'a fortified place with a church'.

    The church was reformed into the church of the Augustinian Priory at Chirbury when the order relocated from Snead (near Bishop's Castle) round about 1220.  With the dissolution of the Priory in 1535, the church became a parish church once again.  The church as seen today is the nave of the Priory.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Church Preen
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The church was built in the 13th Century and is 70 feet long by 13foot wide. It was originally a monastic church, which explains the appearance. The church was founded as a cell of Wenlock Priory in 1163 when the manor was granted to the priory.  The monastic cell survived as a priory until 1534.  The church was probably built circa 1200 AD.

    The west wall collapsed during restoration in 1866, the bell-turret and roof date from this time.

    The pulpit is Jacobean.

    Although the priory buildimgs survived until the 18th Century, they were demolished and replaced by the present Preen Manor in 1870.

    In the churchyard is one of the oldest and largest yew trees in the country.

    The name of the village is thought to be derived from the Old English 'preon' meaning pin or brooch which describes the shape of the nearest hill.

  Name: St Laurence, Church Stretton
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The Domesday book makes reference to a church in the Manor existing before the Norman conquest, most likely a small wooden building.

    The name Stretton is derived from the old name Stratun which means 'tun' (settlement) near to the 'Street' or Roman Road.

    The Norman church was probably built around 1110 to 1130 as the region was growing in prosperity and population (and the Welsh boarder was quieter).

    The church was extended in circa 1214 AD - a new chancel, transcepts in the form of a cruciform and the lower tower were constructed.  A century or so later, the windows were enlarged and the tower was extended.

  Name: All Saints, Claverley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church can trace its origins back to the 7th Century (Saxon), however, the present church dates from the 12th Century.

    Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, held the manor and the church was connected with the collegiate foundation which he endowed at Quatford.

    The church was added to in the 13th and 15th Centuries - the tower was doubled in height and angle buttresses were added to it towards the end of the 15th century.  At about the same time the north chapel was added.

    The church is noted for the medieval wall paintings which have been dated to circa 1200, and includes a frieze of fighting knights, under which is painting depicting the martyrdom of Saint Margaret of Antioch.

    The northwest buttress of the tower, which was added in the 15th century, projects inside the church forming a round-headed niche, known as the 'seat of penitence'.

    The font is Norman, shaped like a tub, and carved with arcades.  The pulpit is Jacobean, and is carved with rosettes under arcading.

    The stained glass in the east window dates from 1858, is by Frederick Preedy, and depicts the Te Deum.

    The tomb-chest is a monument to Sir Robert Broke, who died in 1558, and his two wives is in alabaster with three recumbent effigies, and children standing around the sides.

    The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1906 by J. W. Walker, and rebuilt in 1964 by W. Hawkins.  There is a ring of eight bells, the oldest are two bells cast in 1703 by Abraham Rudhall I, followed by a single bell by Thomas Rudhall in 1769. Another single bell is dated 1877 and is by John Taylor and Company. The last four bells were cast in 1929 by Gillett and Johnston.

    The name Claverley means 'clover meadow'.

  Name: St Margaret, Clee St Margaret
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Saxon / Norman
  Description: |
    The name of the village derives from the Old English 'cleo' (clee) meaning a ball, used in this case to mean a ball-shaped hill (referring to the distictive shape of the Clee Hills) and the saint to which the church is dedicated.

    The exact date of the church is unknown, although there was probably a Saxon church on the site.  The most notable feature of the present building is the extensive herring-bone masonry.

  Name: St Mary, Cleobury Mortimer
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Cleobury passed to the Mortimer family (one of the great Marcher families) after the Norman conquest.  The name Cleobury derives from the Old English for ball (cleo) which describes the shape of the hill and burh (a fortified place).

    It is likley that there was a Saxon church on the site as the presence of a priest is recorded in the Domesday Book.  The present church is largely Early English - the earliest part is the tower, which dates from the 12th Century.  The spire was added during the following Century.  The nave and chancel were built in the 13th Century, with the aisles, chantry chapel and porch being added later in that Century.  The nave and chancel roofs date from the 14th Century, and the north vestry from the following Century.  The arcades lean outwards and were first stabilised by Thomas Telford in the 1790s, buttresses were added later.  The church was restored in 1874-75 by George Gilbert Scott.

    Te spire was re-shingled in 1994.  The shingled spire is not quite symmetrical when seen from certain viewpoints.

    The east window contains stained glass dated 1875, designed by Harry Burrow, and made by Powell's, depicting The Vision of Piers Plowman.

    The organ was made in 1884 by Nicholson, it was rebuilt in 1904, and further improved in the 1970s.  There is a ring of six bells - five of these were cast in 1757 by Adam Rudhall, and the other in 1925 by Gillett and Johnston.

  Name: All Saints, Clive
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: circa 1190 AD
  Description: |
    Evidence suggests there was a little wooden church at the site in 599 AD (and noted in St Augustine's record of early Christian sites).  By Anglo-Saxon times the chapelry was held by the collegiate Church of St Mary, Shrewsbury.  Strong links were also established Haughmond Abbey as Clive was a profitable parish (although small).  By 1578 the parishioners had taken matters into their hands and raised sufficient funds to repair the chapel and appoint their own Minister.

    The first major restoration occured from 1628-54.  A second rebuilding programme took place in 1849.  Finally, the church was fully restored in 1885-87 (made possible by the patronage of J J Bibby owner of the Liverpool shipping line and Hardwicke Grange and Thomas Meares, a tea plantation owner living at Clive Hall).  The spire was added in 1894 at the expense of J J Bibby in memory of his wife.  There is some medieval masonry remaining in the north wall and the north doorway (late Norman) was preserved from the original church.

    The peal of six bells is the heaviest in the county, they were installed on 22nd September 1894 having been ordered in November 1892 from the John Taylor Bell Factory of Loughborough (at a total cost of 1,432 pounds 18 shillings 7 pence).  The collective weight requiring support has been calculated as in excess of 81 hundredweight or over 4 tons, and this set is currently ranked as the eleventh heaviest peal of six in the world, this standing calculated according to the weight of the large Tenor bell which alone weighs over 25 hundredweight.

    The organ is an original by Henry Wills (Wills is regarded as the foremost organ builder of the Victorian era).

    The name of settlement simply derives from the Old English 'clif' meaning an escarpment or hill slope.

  Name: St Cuthbert, Clungunford
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    There was an earlier wooden church on the site (also dedicated to the Anglo Saxon St Cuthbert).  The present building was started round about 1305 by the then Lord of the Manor, Roger de Halberdine, just before a mini ice age.  The villagers continued building the church for more than 40 years.  It is known (by dendrochronological dating) that the roof beams are of local oak felled in 1329-39 and put up straight away.

    The Earl of Arundel probably helped with the costs as Roger de Halberdine had been bankrupted by the church build costs.

    The side chapel was reroofed in 1415 after a fire, and the Victorians added a stone tower to house the bells.

    Earlier glass and decations were destroyed in the Reformation, but the tomb recess (for Roger de Halberdine) and the 14th Centurt parish chest remain.

    The organ is considered to a fine work of Binns (one of the most successful and prolific of the numerous Yorkshire organ builders working at the turn of the 20th century).

    The name of the settlement derives from the name of the river (Clun, origin of name unknown), a ford and a personal name.

  Name: Holy Trinity, Coalbrookdale
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1854 AD
  Description: |
    With the support of the Darbys a new church was planned for the village of Coalbrookdale.  The foundation stone was laid by Abraham's wife, Matilda Frances, on 11th December 1851 and the completed building was consecrated by the Bishop of Hereford on 25th July 1854.

    The church is notable because unusually a number of the gravemarkers were locally cast in iron.

    The most notable grave is that of Abraham Darby IV and his Wife Matilda.

    Other memorial plaques of note are the one for Captain Matthew Webb and Thomas Parker (a famous electrical engineer and inventor).

    The window depicting the last supper is a rare 16th Century Flemish window - note that Judas Iscariot is portrayed with five fingers and a thumb, seen as a mark of the devil at the time.

  Name: St Andrew and St Mary, Condover
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    In Anglo-Saxon times, Condover was a minster church served by a college of priests and so was the centre of an extensive parish - there were a number of dependent chapelries in nearby settlements.  Before the Norman invasion the manor was held by Edward the Confessor.  The Domesday book mentions the presence of a priest, but all trace of the original building has been lost.

    It is thought that masonry from buildings at the Roman City at Wroxeter has been incorporated into the fabric of the church.

    The medieval church was substantially destroyed in 1660 when the tower collapsed.  The Norman north transcept and the Early English chancel were all that were left intact.  The church was rebuilt in 1662-64.  The chancel was then rebuilt again in 1867-68 by Reginald Cholmondeley, who was lord of the manor.  The hammer beam roof also dates from the 17th Century.

    The church is one largest country churches in Shropshire.  The church contains a notable collection of monuments.

    The churchyard contains one of the finest collections of church monuments in Shropshire, the earliest from the 16th century.  Most of these monuments and family tombs date from the 18th and 19th centuries.

    The name of the village means bank or ridge by the River Cound, the suffix 'ofer' is the Old English word meaning the tip of a promontory or a flat-topped ridge.

    In the Domesday book the name of the village is recorded as Conendovre.

  Name: St Peter, Cound
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is dedicated to St Peter because of its medieval association with Shrewsbury Abbey, which is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.

    The oldest part of the church is the nave which dates from the 13th Century, and although the south aisle was built at the same time as the nave it was rebuilt a century later.  Since then the church has been added to quite considerably.  The tower was added in the 15th Century and in 1841/1842 the north aisle was built.  In 1862 the chancel was built and in 1889-91 the vestry was added re-using the 13th-century priest's door.

    The church is constructed in red and yellow sandstone.  In the older parts of the building the colours are used randomly, and for the 19th Century additions the blocks are deliberately arranged.

    The interior has many features of interest including the font which dates from the 12th Century (Norman) and the Pulpit which is dates 1633 (Jacobean).  In the chancel are re-used medieval tiles.  Over the chancel arch is part of a 15th Century wall painting of the Last Judgement.  There are many monuments on the interior walls.  In the churchyard is a sandstone cross base dating from the 18th Century or earlier.

    The name of the village is taken from the nearby brook, Cound Brook.  In the Domesday book, the manor was recorded as Cuneet.

  Name: Christ Church, Cressage
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1841 AD
  Description: |
    The name Cressage means 'Christ's Oak', and so it is thought the village's location may be a very early Christian site (possibly an oak tree from where the gospel was preached).

    There was a medieval church at Cressage, but it suffered repeated flooding from the nearby river Severn and so the current church was built on higher ground.  The rather austere church was architected by Edward Haycock snr (Haycock was responsible for 14 churches in Shropshire, other work by him includes Millichope Park and the Lord Hill monument in Shrewsbury).

    The octagonal pulpit is made of panelling from St Samson's church (the old medieval church).

  Name: All Saints, Culmington
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 11th Century
  Description: |
    In the Domesday Book the settlement is recorded as Comintone and was held by wild Edric from Roger de Montgomery.

    The nave is unusual in that there is herringbone masonry in both the north and south walls indicating a date of late Saxon or early Norman (1050 AD to 1125 AD).  The chancel was extended a century later.

    The tower is 13th Century, the lower part of the spire was added about a century later, but was never completed.  The present top was added in the 1960s, put in place with a helicopter, and replaced a lead cap which had become porous.

    The windows are mainly 14th Century, although two small windows in the nave are 11th Century and the east window is of about 1865 (when there was a major restoration).

    The unusual roof structure is probably late medieval (1500 AD).  The rood screen dates from the 15th Century and has survived the Reformation in 1534 and later restorations.

    There are two fonts, one Victorian, the other Norman (circa 1150 AD) which came from Burwarton church when it closed.  There are also two piscinas, one is a particularly fine example of a double piscina.

    There are remains of wall-paintings from the 16th or 17th Century which depict the 10 commandments.  The stained glass in the aisle is considered to be particularly good, it depicts St Michael and a Christian soldier (made in 1901 and given in memory of a Captain killed in the Boer War).

    Many of the monuments are to the family who were Lords of the Manor of Culmington.  The three bells were recast by Thomas Clibury of Wellington, one in 1629 and the other two in 1663.

    The origin of name of the settlement is uncertain, but most likely derives from Culm (Old English for winding river as the river Corve is close and may have been called Culm (from the Welsh)) and the Old English 'ingtun' meaning 'a farm / settlement called after or connected with', so is the settlement of dwellers on the Culm.

    There was originally a medieval church for Dawley, but it as badly affected by mining susidence and was replaced by the present building at a different site.

    Architectural evidence and reference to there having been a priest of Dawley in 1186-7, suggest that there was a chapel at Great Dawley before the end of the 12th Century.

    It was  with the intention that St Leonard's at Malinslee would take over the role of parish church from  Holy Trinity church, especially as the majority of parishioners were living in the north of the parish around the Dawley Green, Malins Lee and Old Park areas.  The five bells, communion plate and chalice were moved to the new church at Malins Lee.  Legend has it that these were taken by Dawley parishioners one night and returned to Holy Trinity church when it was rebuilt in 1845.

    The architect was Harvey Eginton who also built Broseley.

    The font is late Norman and is a survivor from the old church (and is considered an excellent example).  It has a tree of life on one side.

    The name of the settlement means 'wood/clearing connected with Dealla' alternating with 'Dealla'a wood/clearing'.  Derived from a personal name and the Old English 'leah' meaning a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St Peter, Easthope
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The carved oak screen and oak pews are dated 1623.  Some of the stained glass is by Kempe.

    Projecting from the pulpit is a wrought iron hourglass holder, the hourglass was used to restrict the ‘extraordinary length of services’ in 1662.  Hourglasses were introduced in the 17th Century in many churches to measure the duration of the parson’s sermon, but few survive.

    In 1923 the church was bad,y damaged by fire, the rebuild by the villagers is in much the same style as the original.

    The carillon bell-ringing mechanism is usual for an English church, as it is more in keeping with those found in European churches.

    Easthope is one of a series of settlement names which end in the Old English hop, 'valley', although it should be noted that this one is, in fact, not the easternmost of these.

  Name: St Mary, Eaton Constantine
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1841 AD
  Description: |
    Eaton Constantine was originally a dependent chapelry of Leighton but became a separate parish in the later Middle Ages.  The original church was replaced in 1841 by the present building.

    The only item remaining from the old church is the Norman font.

    The name Eaton Constantine is derived from the old English words for river and farm/settlement (ea and tun respectively).  The settlement was held by Thomas de Constentin family in 1242.

  Name: St Edith, Eaton-under-Heywood
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    St Edith is said to be the daughter of King Egbert of Wessex (reigned 802 to 839).  The Domesday Book does not mention this settlement, but does include the nearby Ticklerton.  But with the expansion of the Wenlock Priory estates, Eaton was a more central and suitable location for a parish church to serve the surrounding hamlets.

    The nave and chancel are Norman and the chancel is Early English.  The upper part of the tower has Perpendicular battlements.  The nave roof dates from the 15th Century, and the chancel roof from about 1600.  The central aisle has a distinct slope to it.

    Between the roofs of the chancel and nave is a tympanum painted in the 1860s with the arms of local landowners.  Along the feet of the rafters are a series of carved faces.  The pulpit is dated 1670 and is a good example with a sounding board, although the lower part may date from the 16th Century.  The font is probably Norman and the unique chain hung cover dates from 1872.

    In the Early English chancel are three widely spaced plain lancet windows of equal height depicting subjects relating to St Edith - an unusual arrangement - the windows were restored in 1869 and so it is unknown if this was the original design.

    In the north wall of the chancel is a 14th Century recess which contains an oaken effigy of a civilian.

    In the chancel is a carved green man.

    There is a ring of three bells, the two oldest were cast in 1615 and 1622 by William Clibury, and the third by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1869.

    The name of the place derives from the Old English 'ea' meaning a river and tun meaning an enclosure, farmstead, village or estate (despite the place being on a small tributary of the river Onny).  Heywood was a royal forest mentioned in 1250, again from the Old English 'haeg' meaning a fence or enclosure and 'wudu' meaning a wood, or wood / timber.

  Name: St Peter, Edgmond
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1080 AD
  Description: |
    The original Norman church was enlarged in the 13th Century, when the tower, porch and aisle were added.  It was then and almost completely rebuilt during the following two centuries, re-using some of the 13th Century material.  The church was further restored in 1877-78 by G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice).

    Inside, the stone reredos dates from 1899 and was designed by Bodley and Garner, it depicts the Crucifixion and saints.  The window in the south wall of the chancel is by William Morris (1876), it depicts the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene.  The west window beyond the bell ringing chamber was created by Hardman in the nineteenth century, it shows St. Francis at the centre and the wonders of creation. The font is early Norman.

    The painted sundial on the exterior is 18th Century.

    The name Edgmond means 'Ecgmund's hill' - the settlement is situated at the summit of a hill 200-250 ft above sea level.

  Name: St Michael, Ford
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: circa 1200 AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday survey, the manor at Ford was one of the most prosperous in the county.  The church occupies the highest site in the village.

    The nave and chancel originally date from circa 1200, but very little of the medieval building remains.  Most of the present building dates from 1875 when the church was restored.

    The church is most noted for the 15th Century roof of the nave, which consists of alternate hammer beams and collar beams with arched braces; at the sides are three tiers of cusped wind-braces.

    The screen is late Perpendicular and the reredos is Jacobean woodwork with five panels of human figures said to be of 16th Century Flemish workmanship.

    The name of the village derives from the fact that there are one or more fords across the river Severn in near proximity to the settlement (just to the north).

  Name: St Bartholomew, Glazeley
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1875 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield.  It is thought that there was a Saxon church here as a priest is mentioned in the Domesday Book.  A medieval church was recorded in 1790, but there is no trace of either of the prior churches remaining.  Blomfield also designed the font.

    The east window is from 1888 by Kempe and depicts the Adoration of the Shepherds.  There is an old Norman tub font from the previous church.

    The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, Glaes may refer to the Old English for glass or bright / clear perhaps describing a lost stream.  Leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St John, Great Wollaston
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1788 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was built in 1788. It replaced a former chapel dating from 1300 AD and was constructed using rubble from the old chapel. From 1864 to 1871 this was the parish church of Great Wollaston. In 1871 the church at Middletown became the parish church because there was no land available in Great Wollaston for a burial ground.

    The church was considerably restored in 1855.

    The name of the village derives from a personal name (perhaps 'Wiglaf') and the old English for a farmstead or settlement (tun).

  Name: All Saints, Grinshill
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1839-40 AD
  Description: |
    The church is a rare example of a new-Norman church and is built of red Grinshill sandstone.

    The chancel screen was carved by six parishioners and presented in 1898 in commemoration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  The pulpit was given in 1900 and the font in 1889.

    Grinshill was originally a chapelry of Shawbury (known to be so as early as 1130 AD) and was an independent church by the 17th Century.  It has been suggested that some remains of prior buildings do exist at the base of the tower.

    The origin of the name of settlement is uncertain, it may mean 'trap hill' (perhaps where animals were snared or it maybe describes the shape of the hill).  Grynel is an unknown Old English word, but maybe related to the word 'grin' for a noose or snare.  Hyll is the Anglian for a hill or elevated ground.

  Name: St Mary Magdalene, Hadnall
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1140 to 1150 AD
  Description: |
    The church was originally a chapel of ease (a church built within the bounds of a parish for those who could not easily attend the parish church), the Norman nave is thought to date from 1140 to 1150.  It is thought that the nave may have been rebuilt in the 14th Century.  The tower was added in the 1830s and the chancel was built in 1874.

    General Sir Rowland Hill (died in 1842), who was Wellington's second in command at the Battle of Waterloo is buried in a sealed crypt beneath the tower and there is a monument to him in the church.

    The name of the village is derived from the Old English meaning 'Headda's nook of land' ('halh' is a nook of land or a piece of land detached from the main area of its administrative unit).

  Name: St Thomas, Halford
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The place name Halford means hawkers' ford (hawker meaning travelling seller) - the Ford is across the river Onny that runs very close to the church.

    The church is of Norman origin, and was restored in 1848.  The chancel was totally rebuilt in 1887.

  Name: St Mary, Harley
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 14th Century
  Description: |
    The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as it had been bestowed to the Norman Lord Helgot.

    Little is known of the origins of the church, but the tower is the oldest part, and it is considered to be from the 14th century.  The main body of the church was demolished in 1845 and was rebuilt by 1846 at a cost of £550.  The architect was S. Pountney Smith of Shrewsbury.

    The church has maintained its Victorian Box Pews.

    The font is late Norman and because it is so plain in design and structure, it was replaced by a Victorian-designed font around the time of rebuilding the church.  In the early 20th Century, the Norman font was brought back into the church, and the Victorian-designed font was placed outside.

    The original Church Clock was made in 1701 and that was replaced in 1814 to the present clock.

    Harley is the only village in Shropshire that is entitled to be called a ‘Thankful Village’ because after the First World War, all twenty of the men who had gone to serve in the war returned safely.  Consequently there is not a war memorial in the village, but there are two memorials, one in the village hall and the other in the church both recording the names of the men who served. 

    The name of settlement probably means, 'rock wood/clearing'.  Haer is the Old English for a rock, a heap of stones, a tumulus, and leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: None, Heath
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: circa 1140 AD
  Description: |
    Heath is an ancient chapelry of the parish of Stoke St Milborough, and the chapel is the only remianing structure of the medieval village.

    The chapel is a rarity in that it has been virtually unaltered for 850 years - the only change in that time being the enlargement of the window in the north wall approx. 300 years ago.

    The door retains some 12th Century wrought iron-work.  The font is Norman.  The pulpit and box pews date from the 17th Century.

    The medieval wall paintings are awaiting conservation, they were discovered in 1911.  The identified subjects of the wall paintings include Saint George on the south wall, and the Last Judgement above the chancel arch. The 17th-century texts are present but faded.

    The name of the settlement is from the Old English for Heather; a tract of uncultivated land.

  Name: St Michael, High Ercall
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday book, High Ercall was one of the most prosperous manors in the county.

    The present church replaced an earlier church built at the end of the 11th Century and probably dedicated to Edward the Confessor.

    The church was damaged in the Civil War; the extent of the damage is unclear as some accounts describe an almost total rebuild of the church between 1657 and 1662 whereas others suggest that the medieval church largely survived.

    The church was also restored in 1864 to 1865.

    The oldest part of the church is the Norman tympanum which has been dated to 1110-25 (and is now built into the north wall).  Also in the church is an effigy of a cross legged knight which is dated circa 1320.  On the external north wall of the tower is the fragment of an early carving depicting a crowned figure on horseback and inscribed St Edwardus.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning a high place (heah) of gravel, mud or earth (ear) which is bare or lacking in vegetation (calu).

  Name: St Luke, Hodnet
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Hodnet has been an important village since Anglo-Saxon times (it is believed that there was a church on the site in Anglo-Saxon times, but no remnants exist).  The church is mentioned in the Domesday Book, however.  Following the Norman conquest, the church was founded and given to Shrewsbury Abbey, the Abbey held the church until it was disolved in 1540.  Prior to 1420, the church was dedicated to St Peter and St Paul and from 1420 St Luke.

    The church is constructed of sandstone and is somewhat unusual in that it has twin 'naves' (the original nave is what is now the south asile), a long seven bay arcade and three gables at the east end.

    In particular, it is noted for its tower which is entirely octagonal from top to bottom and the only tower of this type in Shropshire (it is thought that it was constructed by the same stonemasons who built Caernarvon Castle in Wales).  The belfry originally housed six bells, they were cast by Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester and installed in the tower in 1769.  Two further bells, by Taylors of Loughborough, were added in 1947 in memory of the fallen of the 1939-45 war.  The clock is dated 1848 and was made by Joyce of Whitchurch.

    Much of the nave of the Norman church survives.  In the 14th Century, the Norman church was lengthened to provide a new and larger chancel.  The north aisle was also built in the 14th Century, alongside the old Norman church as was the tower.

    The church was extensively restored in 1846.

    In 1870, the mortuary chapel (the Heber chapel) was added, providing the third gable at the east end.  Bishop Heber is the most famous rector of Hodnet, he came to Hodnet in 1807 and remained for 15 years.  During that time he wrote many famous hymns.  In 1823, he became Bishop of Calcutta and so spent the rest of his in India.

    The pulpit dates from 18th Century, and the font is most likely 17th Century (although it has Norman characteristics).

    The window behind the organ was constructed to depict the evangelists and is the work of Shropshire artist David Evans.  This window has become famous because of the story of the Holy Grail of King Arthur and was brought to the public interest through the book the 'Da Vinci Code'.

    The church has many impressive monuments, mostly dedicated to the Hill family of Hawkstone Hall.

    Hodnet's name has Celtic origins derived from the Welsh hawdd meaning pleasant or peaceful and nant, a glen or valley.

  Name: Holy Trinity, Holdgate
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday book, Stantune was one of a small number of manors in Shropshire with both a church and priest, suggesting there was a Saxon church here.  The parish is now one of the smallest in the diocese.

    The nave and possibly part of the chancel date from the 12th century, with the rest of the chancel and the lower part of the tower from the following century.  The south porch was probably added in the 14th Century and is notable for its carving.  The upper part of the tower dates from the 15th or 17th Century.  The church was restored in 1854 to 1855 and again in 1894 to 1895.

    The pews are box pews, one of which has a desk dated 1707 attached to its back.  Also in the church is a pair of Jacobean seats with carved canopies.  The circular Norman font is elaborately carved with rope moulding, a dragon, interlace, foliage, and medallions.  In the church are royal arms of 1757.  In the south wall of the nave is a tomb recess dating from the 14th century.

    During the Middle Ages, the parish was served by three portionists (priest, deacon and sub-deacon)who formed a secular college, this arrangement survived the Reformation.

    The name of the settlement is Helgot's castle', but the 'castle' has been lost.  Helgot was the name of the tenant in 1086.  In the Domesday Book, the place is called Stantune, from The Old English stan and tun, 'stone farm/settlement'.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Hughley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The church was rebuilt in circa 1360, with only the north wall of the 13th Century nave retained from the previous building.

    The bell tower dates from 1701 and the porch is sometime before that.  The church was restored in 1871-2.

    The church has what is considered to be the finest rood screen in Shropshire, which dates from the end of the 15th Century.  It is believed to have been moved to the church from Buildwas Abbey following the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII.  It is thought to have been made in Ludlow.

    There are traces of medieval stained glass in the north and east chancel windows (late 14th Century).

    The oak parish chest is likely medieval.

    To the right of the altar is a corbel, which has the form of a lady's head. In the south wall is a pillar piscina, something which is not normally seen in Anglican churches. In the floor of the chancel are medieval tiles.  The roof is of note, put in the 1870s the roof is a boarded trussed-rafter roof with bosses.

    The pulpit is Jacobean.

    The church is mentioned in Housman's A Shropshire Lad.

    The original building was an ancient chapelry of Much Wenlock, and was founded before 1176. It was rebuilt during the 13th and 14th centuries out of limestone rubble and sandstone ashlar dressing, becoming a parish church in its own right during the 16th century.

    Hughley is not mentioned in the Domesday book, but the settlement was held by Wenlock Priory in the hundred of Condover. This original manor was known as Legh or Leye, the name Hugh comes from Sir Hugh de Lega (likely a knight who received land grants) who was first mentioned in circa 1170.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Ightfield
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1490 AD
  Description: |
    Mentioned in the Doomsday book as Istefelt, the name Ightfield may derive from the Old English 'Ihtfeld' (Iht means creature and Feld means field), referring to the fact that the area was rural and farming was prevalent.  Alternatively, it is thought it could dervice from Giht, an ancient British river name.

    The church has 15th Century origins and was partly rebuilt in the 19th Century (although records show a church here dedicated to St John the Baptist in 1072 AD).

  Name: St Luke, Ironbridge
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1837 AD
  Description: |
    The area was originally part of the parish of Madeley, but with the growth of the population due to the bridge, it was thought necessary for Ironbridge to have its own church.  The church was designed by Thomas Smith of Madeley and the lowest offer to build was accepted (that of Samuel Smith and Son of Madeley Wood) - the final cost of the building was 2,942 pounds 16 shillings 1 pence.  It is understood that 321,000 bricks were used (then priced at 8s 0d per thousand).

    The position of Ironbridge church is the reverse of the majority of churches, the sanctuary is at the west end and the tower at the east end.  This is because the land at the west end would not bear the weight of a tower.

    The church was completed by the middle of 1837, but owing to the death of the then Bishop of Hereford, it was not consecrated until 26th October 1837, although permission was given to hold services prior to consecration.

  Name: St Mary, Jackfield
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1863 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was build in 1863 to replace a chapel (dating from 1759).  The church was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and is considered to be the best of the four Shropshire churches he designed.  Blomfield was a prolific architect, and a leading figure in his profession.

    The church has an unusual bell-turret, the style is French Gothic which was in vogue in the 1860s.  The church is most noted for its tiles - there are both Maws and Craven Dunhill tiles in the building.

    The sanctuary windows are claimed to be of the school of the Pre-Raphaelites.  The triptych behind the altar was originally produced in about 1870 for an exhibition in Paris, it is a demonstration of the skills at Craven Dunhill in making hand-painted tiles.

    The stone font was presented to the church by the godchildren of George Pritchard (the church was constructed in memory of Pritchard, who died in 1861 - he was a banker, benefactor and High Sheriff of Shropshire).

  Name: St John the Baptist, Kenley
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    The date of this church is uncertain, but the nave and chancel probably date from the 12th Century - evidenced by the round headed doorway in the north wall of the nave.

    This church has an unusual low tower whose pyramid roof starts below the ridge of the nave roof.

    The church was restored in 1854 and again in 2016.

    The chancel roof is considered to be an excellent example of a roof with collar-beams on arched braces, with wind-braces laterally.  The roof is thought to be 14th Century.

    The best feature in the church is the pulpit, a Jacobean structure complete with its tester.

    The name of the settlement means in Old English 'Cena's wood/clearing' - Cena is a personal name, and leah is a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).

  Name: None, Langley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    In 1313 the lords of the manor at Langley (the Burnell's of Actor Burnell) obtained permission to build a chapel at Langley.  The structure of the present building dates from this time.  The chapel was fitted out in about 1546 by the Lee family (to whom the manor of Langley had passed in the second half of the 14th Century).  The chapel was re-roofed in 1601 by the same family.

    By the start of the 18th Century, the chapel had largely fallen out of use, and so avoided the changes being made to churches to re-order interiors to the more elaborate 'high church' model favoured in the 19th Century.  Consequently, it is the set of early 17th Century fittings that makes this chapel significant.

    The last regular service was held at Langley Chapel in 1871.

    The name of the settlement derives from the Old English meaning long wood/clearing - lang (long or tall) and leah (a forest, wood, glade or clearing, and later a pasture or meadow).

  Name: St John the Evangelist, Lawley
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1865 AD
  Description: |
    Lawley was originally a small hamlet, however, the population increased with the discovery of clay and coal just beneath the surface in the 19th Century.  Although within 10 years of the church being built, the coal had been worked out and there was a mass migration away from the area.

    Local farmer Bartholomew Yates engaged with the bishop to requst a church be built, one agrument was that when there was funeral the people had to walk with the coffin to Wellington or Malinslee (four or five miles).

    The church was originally a chapel of ease, built on land donated by the Coalbrookdake Company (the main employer of Lawley's residents) and Lord Forrester.  Much of the building cost was borne by partners of the Coalbrookdale Company.

    The first minister, Thomas Ragg, served from 1865 to 1881.  He was self-educated and was ordained in 1858.

    The church was designed by John Ladds in the Gothic style.  It is of red and yellow brick with stone dressings.  The single bell, made in 1865, was added in 1915.

    Lawley is recorded in the Domesday book, but it was of little value.  The name of the setllement derives from the Old English Lafa's Wood (Lafa is a personal name) and 'leah' is wood or glade.

  Name: St Mary, Leebotwood
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: circa 1200 AD
  Description: |
    Originally a hermitage owned by Haughmond Abbey the stone church was built in circa 1200 AD.  The church was altered in 1829 with the addition of the tower.  A church on the site is first recorded in 1183.  The church is notable for the completeness of its 18th Century and early 19th Centiury fittings and monuments.

    The church is built on glacial moraine, which provided a secure foundation.

    A medieval wall painting of the Nativity was discovered in 1976 and the Welsh dragon carvings on the Western roof truss are of particular note.  The wall painting depicts large late medieval figures which are fragmentary and are of Mary and Christ receiving gifts from what are either angels or Kings.

    The panelled box pews date from 1776.

    There are many monuments, especially notable is the large tablet monument to Sir Uvedale Corbett (d.1701) with gadrooned base, flanking columns, and swan-necked pediment with 2 reclining figures.

    The name of the settlement means 'Botta's wood' with the later addition of 'clearing'.  From the Old English 'wudu' meaning a wood; or wood, timber, and, 'leah' meaning a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Lilleshall
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: circa 1190 AD
  Description: |
    The earliest part of the present building is the south doorway which is late-Norman.  However, it is thought that there has been a church on the site since the 7th century.  St Chad is said to have visited Lilla's Hill to spread the Gospel in 670AD, and a small Saxon church was built.

    In the Domesday book this was one of manors held on behalf of St Alkmund's, Shrewsbury.

    The present building was built in stages over 400 years.  Parts of the nave also date back to Norman times, while the chancel is Early English and the north aisle was added in about 1300.

    At the west end of the nave is a Royal Coat of Arms with the initials CR, it is unknown if this is for Charles I or II.

    The roofs are thought to be late medieval.

    The reredos were presented to the church by the Duchess of Sutherland during the 1856 restoration.  It is a sculpture in a single piece of stone depicting the Biblical seen of Jesus at table in the village of Emmaus, near Jerusalem, following the Resurrection. In the carving, sculptor John Farmer of London captures the moment when the two disciples recognised Jesus, as recorded in Luke's Gospel.

    The church has a fine two-manual organ which was installed in 1891.

    In the north wall of the chancel is one of the finest monuments in Shropshire, dedicated to Sir Richard Leveson (d. 1661) and and his wife (d. 1664). It features two reclining figures, with an architectural surround, columns on each side and a pediment above.  Sir Richard Leveson was a politician who supported the Royalists during the Civil War.

    The font, with its intricate carvings, is thought to predate the church, possibly dating back to circa 900AD.   There is a story that it originally came from Lilleshall Abbey, but it has also been suggested that it might have been in the original Saxon church.

    On the outside of the church is a sundial (in situ by 1787) and a bronze wall tablet.  The tablet was put up in 1896 and indicates how to obtain the time by adding and subtracting various numbers on certain days of the year. Prior to 'Railway Time' each town had its own time based on noon and measured by local sundials.

    The name of settlement means Lill's (personal name) Hill.

  Name: St Leonard, Linley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is a near-complete twelfth-century church.  It is built entirely from local rubble stone except for the dressing stones and a tiled roof and was built as a chapel of ease for Much Wenlock.

    The north doorway is blocked but its weathered tympanum features a mysterious green man.

    The interior contains more Romanesque carving as illustrated by the round tub font.  The decoration consists of carved cable-moulding around the rim, and medallions which, on the north side, emerge from the mouths of demonic masks.

    The altar triptych of a cross and angels painted on board is by Harry Burrows circa 1870.

    Some restoration in the nineteenth century led to tiled floors throughout, with encaustic tiles in the sanctuary by Maw & Co. In 1858 Sir Arthur Blomfield paid for the enlargement of the nave windows, the rebuilding of the east wall with a new window, the installation of new benches, and pews and choir stalls with shaped ends and open backs. The chancel has a panelled dado made in 1858 from former pews.

    The name of the settlement means 'Lime-tree wood/clearing' from the Old English 'lind' (a lime-tree) and leah a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St Laurence, Little Wenlock
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The oldest surving part of the church is the Lady Chapel, which dates from the 12th Century (and the list of incumbents goes back to 1260).  The original nave, which is now the north aisle, is medieval (thought to be 15th Century as the arch-braced roof is typical of this period).  The tower was added in 1667.  The brick nave was added in 1822 and the chancel in 1875.

    In the tower there are five bells, dating from 1704.

    The church contains one of the earliest known cast iron grave slabs in Shropshire - dated 1611, it is set into the floor of the original chancel.  The church is also noted for the 19th Century stained glass commemorating members of the Forester and Edmonds families.

    The communion table is 17th Century.  There is an oak chest from 1733 and the silver communion is dated 1742.

    In 1849 Abraham Darby IV of Coalbrookdale joined the Church of England, having been raised as a Quaker, he was baptised at this church.

    The name Wenlock is thought to be 'white enclosed place'.  The white probably refers to the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge.  'Winn' is primitive Welsh for white, and 'loca' is Old English for an enclosure.  'Little' derives from the Latin 'parva' for small.

  Name: St Michael the Archangel, Llanyblodwel
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1847-1853 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was the result of rebuilding the old medieval church in stages between 1847 and 1853 by the then vicar.  The almost detached steeple was designed and added in 1855-6 by the same vicar, he was convinced that the shape would be stronger than the usual hollow spire construction where the thickness of the straight sides diminishes towards the apex.  The height is 104 ft (tower 57 ft and spire 47 ft).

    The place name means 'an enclosure (especially a church or churchyard) by a spring or well which is red (this may refer to a red-leaved tree or red soil)'.

  Date: Pre-1569 AD
  Description: |
    The age of the church is unknown, but will have existed prior to 1569 as records from that year mention a chapel on the site.

    The wooden bell turret houses a bell of pre-reformation age.

    This is the only church in England to be named after St. Ruthen - probably a Welsh saint.

  Name: None, Longford
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1300 AD
  Description: |
    Originally a medieval church and now a chapel for the Talbot family.

    The chapel was the south aisle / chancel chapel of the medieval church and is now the only remaining part of the church which was demolished in 1803.  The chapel was built around 1300.

    The wall monument is to Thomas and Anne Talbot (who died in 1686 and 1706 respectively).  Thomas Talbot was a relation of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

    The name of the village simply means (in Old English) long ford, possibly referring to a causeway across the river Strine (a tributary of the river Tern).

  Name: St Mary, Longnor
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1275 AD
  Description: |
    Since its construction, the building has hardly been altered.  The western bell turret is 19th Century.

    The interior is noted for its wooden furnishings, some of which date from the 17th Century.

    The building is considered to be a perfect example of Early English architecture, it is considered to be a rarity among English parish churches as the building is entirely a single medieval style.

    The name of the village derives its name from an alder copse on the banks of the river Cound near to the church ('lang' is the Old English for long or tall and 'alor' is the Old English for an alder tree).

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Loppington
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    There was an earlier church at Loppington, as it is known that in 1190 AD the church was given to Wombridge Priory, but no part of the present building dates from the 12th Century.

    The tower is late 15th Century.

    The porch is dated 1658.  The roof is probably also 17th Century.

    In 1643 the church was held by Parliamentarian forces but was subsequently stormed and taken by the Royalists, considerable damage being caused in the process.  It was restored in 1870.

    The pulpit is probably early 18th Century.

    Loppington was recorded in the Domesday Book as Lopitone.

    The meaning of the name of the settlement is uncertain, it may be a farm/settlement (tun) connected with 'Loppa' (a personal name) or 'farm/settlement at the spidery place' (loppe is the Old English for spider).  'Ing' is a connective particle (linking a first element to a final element) in Old English.

  Description: |
    One of the greatest parish churches in England.

    Nothing remains of the original 11th Century church, but 100 years later a second church was built in a style of mixed Norman and early-English.  It is thought that a barrow was removed in 1199 to enlarge the churchyard.

    There was a massive rebuilding of the church between 1433 and 1471, much of which was paid for by the wealthy Palmers' Guild, which endowed a number of chantries in the church.

  Name: St Michael, Madeley
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1796 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was designed by Thomas Telford and was consecrated on Easter Monday 1797.  There has been a church on the site since Norman times and it was appointed to Wenlock Priory in 1330, the original church had become unsafe and it was demolished in 1794.  The present building has an unusual design - it is an octagonal building on classical lines, but without the portico, columns, pilasters and large windows as seen at Bridgnorth.

    The original church was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, the name of the church was changed after the Reformation to 'St Michael's' suggesting Henry VIII's displeasure with the Catholic Church.

    The chancel was added in 1910.  On the north-east and south-east exterior faces are monuments to the Brooks family (who lived at Madeley Court in the 16th and 17th Centuries. The churchyard is extensive and includes 16 cast-iron tombs (arguably the best collection in the country.

    The name of the settlement in Old English is Mad(d)a's (a personal name) wood/clearing.  Leah is Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St Leonard, Malinslee
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1805 AD
  Description: |
    Malinslee had a 12th Century chapel, which was likely in the parish of Shifnal.  The chapel fell into disrepair in the 19th Century and was demolished in 1971.

    A new church was required in the area to accommodate the increasing population during the early Industrial Revolution.  The church is the third and last of Thomas Telford's three Shropshire churches.  It is similar to Madeley in that it is externally octagonal and built of ashlar.

    It was originally built to seat 800 people, but the galleries were extended in the 1830’s to allow for a further 200 seats The bells, a medieval silver paten and a chalice were taken from the Holy Trinity Church in Dawley to St Leonard’s as it was to be the parish church.

    After pressure from some parishioners for the reopening of Holy Trinity at Dawley, services were resumed there in 1818.  In addition, the plan for St Leonard’s to be the parish church for Dawley was halted in 1821 when it was discovered that an Act of Parliament would be needed to recognise its status.  To promote an Act of Parliament would have been be too costly so the plan was abandoned and St Leonard’s then operated under Dawley Church as a chapel of ease until it was assigned a chapel district in 1843 in recognition of the growing population of the area.

    Legend has it that some male parishioners from Holy Trinity came one night and took back the bells, 16th. Century silver plate and the chalice dating from 1746 that had been given to St Leonard’s and in 1845 they were returned to Holy Trinity.  A new set of plate was donated in 1833 and 5 bells in 1839 to replace the stolen items.

    There is some notable stained glass in the church in the style of Morris and Co.

  Name: St Mary, Market Drayton
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1150 AD
  Description: |
    The Domesday Book describes 'A Priest in Drayton', and there was likely a wooden Saxon church on the same site prior to the construction of the present Norman stone building.

    In 1201 Pope Innocent III forbade the weekly market which had traditionally taken place in the churchyard after the Sunday morning service. As a result, the market moved northwards a few hundred yards, to its present site in the town.

    Little of the original Norman building remains, the tower is 14th Century and retains the 12th Century doorway.  The church was restored and largely rebuilt in 1881 to 1889.

    There is some notable stained glass by Kempe.  The rood screen, now at the west end of the nave, is also by Kempe.

    There is a local tradition that Robert Clive (1725-74), later to become Lord Clive of India, climbed the church tower and sat astride a gargoyle when he was attending the grammar school (q.v.) nearby.

    Market Drayton is on the River Tern, and was formerly known as 'Drayton in Hales' (c. 1868) and earlier simply as 'Drayton' (c. 1695).  The town is of Saxon origin and was referred to as Draituane in the Doomsday Book.  A Drayton (OE  draegtun) is a settlement where dragging takes place.  The name is considered to refer to a portage on a river in some instances, and to a steep slope in others.  In this instance the likeliest reference seems to be to the use of sledges, rather than wheeled vehicles, on marshy ground.

  Name: St Peter, Melverley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Melverley means 'meadow by the mill-ford'.

    The church stands very close to the river Vyrnwy.

    The medieval church was burnt by Owain Glyndwr in 1401.  The present church was built soon after.

    It is noted for being one of just a small number of half timbered churches in the country.  The entire structure is held together with just pegs.  The fact that the wattle and daub is narrower than the timbers shows the early construction of this church using this technique.

  Grade: II*

  Date: 1867 to 1868 AD
  Description: |
    The present building is Victorian, it replaces an 18th Century brick church which itself replaced a medieval church.

    The church is considered to be the best Edward Haycock junior designed church in Shropshire (he is responsible for six other churches in the county).

    The church is noted as it houses one of the best sets of stained glass by Morris and Co in the country.  There are windows by Burne-Jones, Maddox Brown and Morris.  There are also two windows in a different style by Kempe.

    Meole Brace was originally a separate village, the manor of Meole is recorded in the Domesday book.  Meole is the name of the river and Brace is derived from Aldolf de Bracy who held the manor in 1206.

  Name: Holy Trinity, Minsterley
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1692 AD
  Description: |
    The place name implies that there was minster church on the site in Saxon times (as it is recorded in the Domesday Book as Menistrelie), but nothing of any previous building exists.  Throughout the Middle Ages, Minsterley was a chapel of ease to Westbury, and remained so until 1689.  The present church was built between 1688 and 1689, it was funded by the 1st Viscount Weymouth, Thomas Thynne, as the family needed a new church when they acquired the nearby Minsterley Hall.  The Thynne family were local landowners and would become Marqusses of Bath.  The church was consecrated on Trinity Sunday 1692, the delay was probably due to a vacancy in see.  Herbert Croft of Croft Castle near Ludlow had been Dean of Hereford from 1644 to 1661 and Bishop from 1662 to 1691.  It is likely that the journey to Minsterley was too much to undertake at his age and the consecration was delayed until after the enthronement in 1691 of Bishop Gilbert Ironside.

    The Architect was William Taylor, a Londoner who was also employed at Longleat.  The craftsmen were local, the foremason and bricklayer being Thomas Hudson of Shrewsbury, and the carpenter being Joseph Moateham.

    The late 17th Century was not a period of great church-building outside of London (and even there the Churches replaced those consumed by the Great Fire of 1666).  Minsterley's Church is thus a rarity, and doubly so by virtue of a rustic classical-baroque stylistic mixture - the first church is Shropshire built on classical lines.  Minsterley was also the first church in Shropshire to be built in brick.  The dressings are Grinshill stone.

    The church is notable for the carving on the west end of the exterior.

    The church has a collection of seven maiden's garlands, these were placed over the grave of a 'bride to be' who died before her marriage. They were placed in the church in the 18th Century (1736 to 1794), and were made for the funerals of young girls to be placed on their coffins.

    The organ dates from 1884.  The pulpit is old (date unknown), and was transferred from Westbury church.

    The interior was altered in 1865.  The church was further altered in 1870.

    The place name means 'Monastery wood/clearing', from the Old English mynster meaning a monastery, the church of a monastery or religious body, a church served by secular clergy and leah meaning a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.

  Name: St Peter, Monkhopton
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is essentially Norman, but the exterior has been rendered and so covering the original stone work.

    The tower was added in 1835, and the church was restored by the Victorians.

    The decoration around the south window of the chancel has been considered to be 12th Century, but it may be 19th Century.

    The monk prefix of the name of the settlement means the farm or settlement was a possession of Wenlock Priory.  Hop is the Old English for a remote enclosed space; a piece of enclosed land in a fen; an enclosure in marsh or moor (in this case an escarpment valley south of Much Wenlock).  Tun is the Old English for an enclosure; a farmstead; a village; an estate.

  Name: St Chad, Montford
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1737 - 1738 AD
  Description: |
    The church is situated on a knoll above the river Severn.  There was originally a medieval church on the site, but it was replaced in 1737 - 1738 by the present building.  The church was designed by William Cooper of Shrewsbury and is built of red sandstone.  The church was restored in 1884.  A few medieval tiles in the chancel are the only known relics of the old church.

    The reredos (19th Century) is notable and there is some good stained glass by Burlison and Grylls.  The royal coat of arms is painted on canvas.  The new church originally had 3 bells from the previous church dated (1656, 1670 and 1717), but these were sold to help fund a new peel of 6 bells.

    The father and sisters of Charles Darwin are buried in the churchyard, and his mother (the eldest child of Josiah Wedgwood) is buried in the chancel, though there is nothing to mark the position.  It is unknown exactly why the Darwin's are buried here - it is known they visited West Felton and Montford would have been a prominent landmark on the way, alternatively, they may have chosen Montford because of difficulties with burials for Unitarians at the Shrewsbury church.

    The origin of the place name is uncertain, it may mean 'community ford' (mana is the Old English for a community), as it was a place for meetings between English and Welsh representatives during times of negotiation.  The spelling with the T came about because of the association with Simon de Montfort in the 13th century and became more or less official when the lord of the manor, Henry Bromley, was made Lord Montfort in 1741.  Clive of India bought the land in 1760.

  Name: St Peter, More
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The present building comprises the medieval tower (13th Century), a 17th Century north transept and an early Victorian nave and chancel (rebuilt in 1845).

    Inside the box pews and the hammer beam roof are Victorian.  The west gallery is supported by cast-iron pillars.  Near the font is some Roman mosaic, thought to have been brought from a grand tour rather than being taken from a nearby Roman settlement.

    The north transept was built as the More family mortuary chapel.  There is a connection between the More family and the Mayflower (1620) - citation needed.

    The church formerly housed an important library of early theological books which were given to the parish by Richard More in 1680 (his intent was to teach the minister sound doctrine), the books are now at the nearby Linley Hall.

    In Old English 'mor' is a marsh or barren upland, from which the settlement takes its name.

  Name: St Bartholomew, Moreton Corbet
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The Norman church was founded in about 1140 AD as a chapel attached to Shawbury. Some parts of the Norman church remain, but the greater part of the church dates from the 14th Century.

    The south aisle is effectively a memorial chapel to the Corbet family and was constructed in the mid-14th Century. The base of the tower was constructed in around 1539 and features the arms of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VI). It is unknown whether it was originally finished to its full height, as it is possible that the upper stages were damaged during military action in the Civil War. The present upper stages of the tower date from 1769.

    The church has an unusual triangular window, similar to one in Alberbury, which was another of the Corbet family's holdings.

    The interior contains numerous monuments to the Corbet family including two chest tombs dated 1513 and 1567, a baroque wall monument to Richard Corbet dated 1691 and a number of 18th Century monuments. It is known that Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, the architect of the Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, carried out work here.

    The church has a decorative scheme by Ninian Comper dating from 1904 in memory of Vincent Corbet who died at Eton at the age of thirteen. The scheme encompasses most of the chancel interior and includes a stained glass window, communion table, alabaster reredos and canopy, and high quality painted decorations to the walls and roof timbers.

  Name: St Gregory, Morville
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1118 AD
  Description: |
    The church retains almost all of the original Norman features and was constructed within the precincts of a Priory establishment.  This was destroyed in 1540 leaving the church as the parish place of worship.

    The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, the generic is 'open land'. Both a river-name and a hill-name, the latter derived from Celtic mamm, 'hill', has been suggested, but there is as yet no satisfactory etymology for this name.

    Note: Have been inside this church, but do not have any interior photos.

  Name: Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1150 AD
  Description: |
    The first church on this site was Anglo-Saxon, built probably about AD 680.  The present church was built by the Cluniac monks of Wenlock Priory.  The church was extended in 1844 when a new aisle was added and the church refurbished.

    There is a monument to William Penny Brookes (known as the founder of the modern Olympic Games).

    Above the south porch is a 14th Century parvise, or small chamber used as living quarters by the parish priest.

    The tub font is thought to be 12th Century.  The pulpit is Jacobean.

    The name Wenlock is thought to be 'white enclosed place'.  The white probably refers to the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge.

    'Winn' is primitive Welsh for white, and 'loca' is Old English for an enclosure.  'Much' derives from the Latin 'magna' for big or great.

    The church has its origins in the 12th Century, but has grown and been modified over the years.

    The church is noted for its 14th Century wooden porch and medieval stained glass.

    The lower stages of the tower are Norman and the upper stages are Perpendicular.

  Name: St Peter, Myddle
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1634 AD and 1744 AD
  Description: |
    Originally a Saxon foundation pre 1066 held by Siward the Saxon and later given to Shrewsbury Abbey by Warin the Bold.  Nothing is known of the early church.

    The tower was rebuilt in 1634, it had deteriorated badly during the Rectorship of Ralph Kynaston - he had offered to rebuild the tower to his own height if the parishioners paid for the rest (Kynaston died in 1629).

    The rest of the church was rebuilt in 1744.

    Inside the church is a ducking stool from 1660-1685.

    There are three bells. The tenor bell on which the clock strikes weighs 7cwt and was cast by Thomas Clibury of Wellington in 1668.  The second bell is undated is thought to be the work of Michael de Lichfield and cast in his Staffordshire foundry circa 1280.  The treble bell is was cast by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester.

    The organ is by William Hill, of which very few survive.  Unusually the stops are reversed in that those keys that are normally white are black and vice versa.

    The name of the settlement is derived from the Old English mydel meaning 'small confluence', although this is not supported by any present day features of the landscape.  It is named in the Domesday Book as Mulleht.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Myndtown
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church may even date back to before the 12th Century.  It is thought to be unique not just within Shropshire, but in the whole of England, in that it has not been the subject of Victorian restoration or alteration.  It is a simple and plain country church.

    The church has two bells, one is 15th Century, and the other is from 1150, making it one of the oldest bells listed in the National Bell Register.

    Some of the roof timbers have been identified as being from trees felled between 1225 and 1250, which makes them some of the oldest in situ church roof timbers.  The original roof was replaced after about 100 years, the timbers in the replacement roof are from trees felled between 1326 and 1348.

    The name Myndtown literally means place or town by the mynd (mountain).  Myndtown was once a significant medieval village.  The village is recorded as 'Munete' in the Domesday book.

  Name: St Nicholas, Newport
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Although the church dates back to the 12th Century, virtually nothing from this time survives.  The tower was the first part to be rebuilt, which was done in 1360.

    1n 1432 a licence was obtained to found a chantry with two priests, ten years later a college was established with a master and four chaplains.  The college was dissolved in 1547.

    In the 1720s the north aisle and the chancel were built.  These were replaced by the extensive rebuilding in the following century.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1886 by E Haycock jun., John Norton rebuilt the nave and south aisle in 1883-85, the north aisle in 1890-91 and the south porch in 1904.  So, externally the building is a medieval west tower and a Victorian church (both of red sandstone).

    There is an alabaster tomb chest of c. 1520.  The font is dated 1660.  There is some notable stained glass, in the south chapel, the glass is by Kempe and in the chancel, the south window is by Burne-Jones and Ford Madox Brown.

    The name of the town means 'new market town' in Old English.

  Name: King Charles the Martyr, Newtown
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1869 AD
  Description: |
    After the civil war the villagers of Newtown and other nearby villages desired to have a chapel of ease as the parish church of Wem was too far away.  Initially a private house was used which was consecrated after the Restoration in 1665.  In 1836 this building was demolished and replaced with a brick church.  In 1861 the parish was formed and in 1869 the brick church was replaced with the present stone church.

    The church has an unusual Carillon of 6 bells.

    The pulpit is marble and dates from 1898.

    The elegant wrought-iron screen dates from circa 1870.

    The name of the village simply equates to the Old English new (niwe) and enclosure, farmstead or village (tun).

  Name: All Saints, Norbury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The original church was built circa 1200, the tower dates from the late 13th Century / early 14th Century.  The church was substantially rebuilt from 1879 to 1893 (nave 1879-80, chancel 1892-3 and spire 1880).

    The tower has a very distinctive batter (a receding or inward slope) and very thick walls - indicating a degree of defensibility.

    Until 1894 Norbury was a dependent chapelry of Lydbury North.  Also, records from 1521 indicate that the church was dedicated to St Ethelbert.

    The chancel screen is late 19th Century and has a built-in pulpit.  The octagonal font is possibly early 14th Century (one side of which is ornamented with a rosette inside a circle) and retains its original square stem and raised circular plinth.

    The east window is late 19th Century and there is a 17th Century oak chest and 18th Century coat of arms in the tower.

    The yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be circa 2,700 years old, the tree has a girth of approx. 33ft.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English for northern (nord) and fortified place (burh).  There are hill fort defences near the church.

  Name: St Chad, Norton-in-Hales
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    There was an earlier church on the site, but nothing of this building remains.  Of the present church, the chancel was built in the 13th Century and the tower in the 14th Century.  The church was restored in the 19th Century, re-opening in 1865.

    Outside the church is the older font dating from the 12th or 13th Century.

    The arch once connected the church to the rectory, the figure in the niche at the apex  is St Chad in his episcopal cope and mitre.

    The church has an octagonal baptistery (a baptistery is commonly octagonal in plan, a visual metaphor for the number eight, which symbolised a new beginning in Christian numerology).

    The church is notable as it has one of the earliest known commissions by Inigo Jones.  Dating from 1606 and made from Derbyshire alabaster, the commission is a monument to Frances Cotton who died in childbirth.  The monument was later amended to incorporate Sir Rowland Cotton himself who died in 1635. Cotton had various appointments in Shropshire including High Sheriff, member of the Council of the Marches and MP.

    In 1553 the church had three great bells and one Sanctus bell.  Today the church has eight bells.

    The nave is paved of white marble.  The chancel has some Jacobean (1567 to 1625) carving and panelling.  The pulpit is Caen stone and is supported by 16 marble pillars.

    The name Norton in Old English is North farm/settlement.  Hales, in Old English halh meaning 'nooks of land', is an old district name which refers to land on both sides of the Shropshire-Staffordshire border.

  Name: St Michael, Onibury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    The presence of a priest at this place is recorded in the Domesday book, suggesting that there was a pre-Norman church here, althoigh no trace of this remains.

    The earliest feature of the present church is the Norman chancel arch.  The tower is likely to be 14th Century.

    The church was sympathetically restored in 1902 by Detmar Blow with Arts and Crafts fittings.

    There are fragments of medieval wall paintings in the church.

    The Perpendicular (16th Century) pulpit with Jacobean additions is the oldest in Shropshire.

    In the Chancel, there are two 17th Century (1666 and 1673) cast iron grave slabs.

    The name of the settlement means River Onny Fortification (burh is the Old English for a fortified place).  The origin of the name of the river is unknown.

  Name: Holy Trinity, Oswestry
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1837 AD
  Description: |
    The church was built because St Oswald’s could not accommodate the town’s growing population.  The architect was Thomas Penson (the younger) who also built Llanymynech and various churches in Wales.  The Lady chapel was added in 1894.  At the same time a north-west tower with a timber spire was added by Eustace Frere.  An unusual feature is the lancet window filled with stained glass in memory of Queen Victoria.  The font is a marble baluster.

  Name: St Oswald, Oswestry
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    In 642 AD Oswald, the King of Northumbria who had previously converted to Christianity was killed by the pagan King Penda of Mercia in the Battle of Oswestry, as a result he rose to martyrdom.  He is thought to have been killed on the site of the church.

    The present church was built in the 13th Century.  Only the lower parts of the tower remain from the original building as the church was heavily damaged in the Civil War (having been used as a lookout tower).  The church was rebuilt in the 17th Century and further restored in the 19th Century.  Most of the windows are Victorian.

    The church has a memorial to the Yale family - a descendant of the figures in the memorial made his fortune in India in the 18th Century and gave his money to a fledgling university in the USA - Yale.

  Name: St George, Pontesbury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The church was first recorded in 1254, but it is likely the tower is older as pictures of the original tower show distinct Norman features.  During the middles ages, the church was a collegiate church serving the surrounding area.  Unusually the church was staffed by three portioners, one was a dean, the first was responsible for the first 26 services in the year and the other two the next two lots of 13 each.  This arrangement persisted until 1909.

    Before 1825 the medieval Church consisted of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and a northern tower.  In 1772 concerns were raised over the stability of the church and in 1810-11 local architects examined the church.  Soon after this the tower collapsed and in 1825 what remained of the nave and aisles were taken down.  The new rebuilt church was opened in 1829, retaining the medieval chancel.

    In 1897 the body of the church was restored.

    The churchyard is circular which usually indicates a very ancient site and there are several large yew trees.

    The font is Norman.  Also of interest is the aumbry door which is dated 1652.

    There was known to be a clock in the tower in 1788.  The present clock was made in Whitchurch by J B Joyce, and was installed in 1858.

    The name of the settlement means 'Pant's fortification' (an old English personal name and burh) but may be, 'River Pant fortification', an old name for the tributary of the River Rea that passes nearby.

  Name: St Martin, Preston Gubbals
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church was originally built as a chapel of ease in the 12th Century, but later became a parish church. The date of the change to church is unknown, but is likely some time in the 14th or 15th Century.

    In 1866 part of the medieval church was demolished, just the chancel was retained which became the south aisle of a new church.

    The Victorian church was pulled down in 1973, leaving the medieval chancel as the church once again.  The 19th Century arcade was blocked, and now forms the north wall of the remaining building.  A bell from Preston Gubbals is now installed in St Alkmund's Church in Shrewsbury, the bell was cast 1720.

    The sundial in the churchyard was originally a churchyard cross, dated 1638.

    The name of the village in Old English means 'Priests' farm/settlement (tun)'.  It was held in 1086 by a priest name Godebold who was a tenant of St. Alkmund's church in Shrewsbury, the name was corrupted to Gubbals.

    The current church was built between 1739 and 1742 to replace the former church.  The chancel and vestry were added in 1853.

    The name Preston upon the Weald Moors (24 letters) is one of the longest names of any village in England and is thought to have derived from the words 'Priests' farm/settlement' on the 'wild moors' indicating that the village may well have ecclesiastical origins.

    Roger de Montgomery (the first Earl of Shrewsbury who owned most of Shropshire) established the first church (and a castle) at Quatford in 1086 AD, but it wasn't long before Bridgnorth was settled upon as a better location.  De Montgomery's first wife was murdered, his second wife Adeliza de Pusey had to travel from France.  While she was sailing across the English Channel, the priest on board dreamed that if Adeliza survived the journey she should vow to build a church in honour of the Blessed Mary Magdalene at the place where she would first meet her husband.  This is the legend of how Quatford was chosen as the site of this church.  Roger and Adeliza met in 1083 or 1084, the church was completed in 1086 and was richly endowed by de Montgomery.

    The original church was completely rebuilt in the 12th Century.

    The church is notably built of tufa - a type of limestone in which the rock is formed by spring-water laden with calcium carbonate bubbling through spagnum moss.  The use of tufa is an indication of a relatively early Norman building, as it was not much used after c. 1150 (but the church may be an exception).  The tufa walls stood unaided for 500 years, but by the 17th Century sandstone buttresses were added.

    The nave and tower were rebuilt in 1714.  The porch was added in 1857.  Inside, the most notable feature is the tufaceous arch - this is a rare structure.  There are some medieval tiles.  The pulpit is a good Victorian example.  The royal coat of arms is George III.  The font is unusual, the bowl is likely Norman, but the carving could have been added later.  The clock was installed in 1901.

    In the Sanctuary are the remains of some medieval wall painting.  Also in the Sanctuary is a squint.  The piscina dates from the Decorated period.  The altar, pew ends some panelling contain fragments of a Perpendicular rood screen.  There is one original window, the rest were inserted in the 14th Century.

    The significance and origin of the place name Quat is unclear, but ford relates to a ford.  It could be derived from Coed (the Old English for forest) or from Cwead (the Old English for mud), but more likley Cwat was a person's name.

  Description: |
    Ratlinghope is thought to mean 'the valley of Rotel's people' and is set in some of the finest scenery in the county.

    It is likely that most of the building is 17th Century as there are few traces of the the priory that was here until the Dissolution in 1536.

  Name: St George, Rodington
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1851 AD
  Description: |
    The domesday book mentions the presence of both a priest and a church at this place.  The medieval church is long gone however, a Georgian church built at this site in 1751 and this was in turn replaced with the present Victorian church.

    In 1929, a section of wall of the medieval church was discovered.

    The place name Rodington is derived from name of the river (Roden), the origin of which is unknown, and the Old English 'tun' meaning farm or settlement.

  Name: St Mary, Selattyn
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1291 AD
  Description: |
    The village is close to Offa's Dyke and the dyke bounds the parish on the west, the name derives from sulh and tun which means in Old English a plough(-land) farm/settlement, or perhaps, a gully farm/settlement and has also been modified by Welsh influence.

    The churchyard has a number of very old yew trees, suggesting that the site has been a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years.  However, the church itself is first mentioned in the Papal Tax records in 1291.  The church is noted for its 13th Century font and the barrel roof over the chancel, which is thought to be from the 14th Century.  The north and south transepts were added in 1821-28.  The church was extensively rebuilt in 1891-92.

  Date: 1182 AD
  Description: |
    The present building still contains elements of the original Norman building.  The nave and south aisle are the original building, the chancel is 13th Century. The north aisle and tower are 15th or early 16th Century.  The porch is late 16th or early 17th Century.

  Date: 1854 AD
  Description: |
    Although medieval in origin, the church was partly rebuilt in the 1660s and then nearly the whole church was rebuilt in 1854.  The church is noted for the half-timbered belfry which juts out above the west wall.

    The name of the village derives from the Saxon 'shena' and 'tun' meaning beautiful place or farm/settlement.

  Name: All Saints, Shelve
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1839 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was built to replace a medieval structure and is built in the Early English style.  The church contains items from the former church, specifically the rood-beam above the sanctuary, the nine-sided font (which may be Norman) and some 17th Century panelling.

    This church is one of the highest in the county at 1,150 feet above sea level.

    The place name likely derives from the fact it is situated on an area of relatively flat ground in an otherwise undulating terrain, as in 'shelf' of level ground.

  Name: St Andrew, Shifnal
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: Pre-13th Century AD
  Description: |
    Shifnal was an important ecclesiastical centre in Saxon times, and it was a minster of an extensive Saxon parish.  In the Domesday Book, the settlement was known as Iteshale and later became Idshall.  The name Shifnal came into use in the 14th Century and over time replaced the previous name.  In the 12th Century, the church was acquired by Shrewsbury Abbey.

    The main part (nave, porch, aisles, transepts and tower) of the present building is Early English (13th Century), and there are some remains of the earlier Norman church.  The chancel and south chapel were built during the Decorated era.  The Norman chancel ended where the communion rails are now.

    The south porch is a two-storey structure.

    The chancel arch is Norman and round-headed, on of west side of the arch is some dogtooth decoration.  Above the dogtooth is an unusual Norman carving, which Cranage notes 'It appears to be a fruit-bearing twisted branch coming out of the mouth of a human head.  There is a large finial above.'.

    The hammer-beam roofs are 16th Century, as the original roof was damaged in an extensive fire in Shifnal in 1591.

    The font is Victorian as are the west window of the nave and the east window of the chancel.  The pulpit is Jacobean.  There are some notable memorials - Olive Briggs (d. 1596), an alabaster effigy on a tomb chest, Humphry Briggs (d. 1626) and his wife, again effigies on a tomb chest, Thomas Forster (priest, d. 1526) in a tomb recess and a bust of Magdalen  Briggs (d. 1598).

    The name of the settlement means Scuffa's nook of land.  It was also known as Iddeshale, Idi's nook of land.  Halh is nook of land in Anglian.

  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1875 to 1876 AD
  Description: |
    Founded by the Rev. Thomas Mainwaring Bulkeley Bulkeley-Owen and built by Edward Haycock jun., the church was consecrated in 1879.  Historically it was built for the Oxford Movement (a movement largely associated with the University of Oxford, it argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology), and it has the architecture to support this.

    The church has the most important surviving John Nicholson organ in the country, a very important instrument historically.  There are two stained glass windows by Kempe in the north aisle, the nave window is of Whitefriars glass, and one windows is the in arts and crafts style from the workshop of William Morris.

    There is a Banner designed by The Revd Ernest Geldart, stitched by Mary and Harriet Cope and recently restored.  It has a huge rood cross dedicated to the unknown fallen of the First World War.

    The church notably lacks a tower.

  Name: St Alkmund, Shrewsbury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1475 AD
  Description: |
    St Alkmund died circa 802 AD, he was the younger son of Alhred (king of Northumbria) at Lilleshall, his relics were removed to the collegiate church dedicated to him at Derby.  This church in Shrewsbury was also founded as a collegiate church in 912 AD by Aethelflaed, daughter of Alfred the Great, king of Mercia.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was substantially endowed.  However, when Lilleshall Abbey was established in 1148 AD, the church became a poor vicarage as property was transferred to Lilleshall. The original medieval church is thought to have been a very fine example.

    The original Saxon church was rebuilt more than once. The first significant part of the building to remain to the present day is the tower and 184-foot spire, which were built around 1475 AD. Following the collapse of Old St Chad's in 1788, there was concern about the safety of the church.  An act of Parliament decreed the demolition and rebuilding of all but the tower; the rest of the churches dates from circa  1794-5.

    There is Tudor glass in the West window, dating from mid 16th century.

    The church stands at the highest point in the town.

  Description: |
    St Chad was the first Bishop of Mercia, he was canonised in 779 AD.

    After the collapse of the tower of the original St Chad's church, the new church was built to a design by George Steuart (who had previously designed Attingham Park).

    This church is considered to be the finest 18th Century church in Shropshire.  The most striking feature being the circular nave.  The church is brick built and faced with Grinshill stone.

  Name: St Giles, Shrewsbury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1860 to 1863 AD
  Description: |
    The church of St Giles was first recorded in 1136, was originally part of St. Giles Hospital for Lepers and the Infirm (probably situated west of the church) which was first recorded in 1155.  However, the present church is largely Victorian and the work of Samuel Pountney Smith, who extensively re-modelled the church but retained much of the fabric of the medieval chapel within the present building.  Vestries and an organ chamber were added in 1895.

    The north arcade is 14th Century and the former chancel arch from the same period is now placed between the north aisle and chancel, immediately adjacent to a Victoran arch, giving a very odd effect,

    From the mid 15th Century the church became a parish church with Holy Cross (Shrewsbury Abbey).  Prior to 1836, however, services were held only twice yearly.

    In 1857 St Giles and Sutton became a parish in its own right and today works together with the parish of St Eata, Atcham.

    The Norman font is very good (thought to originally have come from High Ercall).  There is stained glass by David Evans and Kempe.

  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    This church dominates Shrewsbury as was built at the highest point in the town and has a spire which is 222ft (one of the tallest in the country).

    The church was largely transformed into its present state in the 12th Century (when Norman (transitional) architecture was giving way to Early English).

  Name: St George, St Georges
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1862 AD
  Description: |
    Prior to 1860, the place St Georges did not exist, the area was then known as Pains Lane.  The area saw rapid growth in the mid-Victorian era, due to the Industrial Revolution, and the present church was built to serve the growing population.

    Originally a chapel of ease in the parish of Lilleshall, the original church was a plain brick building.  The new and present church was designed by G E Street (and is considered his best in Shropshire), and was erected in the memory of George Granville, 2nd Duke of Sutherland.  The foundation stone was laid on 4th November 1861 by the Rt Hon Earl Granville KG, with a silver trowel Earl Granville spread the mortar after having inserted a bottle containing parchment and some new coins into the cavity.

    The stone was quarried locally from the hole to the north of Limekiln Bank.

    Work was not completed on the tower until 1928, which was formally opened in October 1930.

    The church can seat 800.

    The pulpit is stone.

  Name: St Peter, Stanton Lacy
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Circa 1050 AD
  Description: |
    The church is one the few mentioned in the Domesday book.

    The settlement, known as Stantone at the time of Domesday book, was a prosperous place.  It was part Robert de Lacy's land and was held by Siward (an important Earl of northern England in the 11th Century).  Consequently, Stantone had a substantial Saxon church.

    The present building retains some elements of the original Saxon church, and the church was added to in the 13th Century (when the chancel was enlarged) and the 14th Century (when the tower and south transept and aisle were added).

    On the exterior walls are thin pilaster strips (also known as leseners), these are typical of Anglo- Saxon work - the walls between these strips were originally covered by a layer of plaster, but this had been deliberately removed by 1846.  The original Saxon doorway is still present in the north wall.  There are also two sets of canopied tomb recesses in the exterior walls.

    The font dates from the 14th Century.  The stained glass is Victorian.  The organ was installed in 1854 and the pulpit was installed in 1849.

    The Altar and Reredos were installed in 1849, and were originally unpainted.  They are of Caen stone (from north-western France) and were painted in 1930.  The Sanctuary floor is tiled with Ironbridge (Jackfield?) encaustic tiles, with designs by Minton.

    There is an odd feature in the north wall of the nave, its exact purpose is unknown but it was thought to be an Aumbry (a cupboard in the wall, usually in the Sanctuary for holding the Sacraments).  The carved oak is a recent addition (a similar serpent design can be found in Worcester Cathedral).

    The name Stanton means stone farm/settlement (stan is the Old English for a stone or rock) and tun is the Old English for an enclosure, a farmstead, a village or an estate.  Lacy is a family name.

  Name: St Michael, Stanton Long
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    In the Domesday Book, the place is called Stantune, the same as Holdgate.  Stanton Long is likely to have separated from the neighbouring parish of Holdgate some time in the 12th Century.  Alterations later in the 13th Century and the beginning of the 14th Century included new windows in the nave, partly to light a new side chapel, and rebuilding the south chancel wall, which incorporates a piscina and tomb recess.

    The roof is late medieval.  The belfry and porch were added in the 16th or 17th Century.  The church was partly restored in 1842, and further restoration was done in 1869 to 1871.

    The south porch has some ancient timbers at the entrance, and the side walls are Victorian.  The south door is dated circa 1200.  The chancel arch is Victorian.  There are two piscinae, one in the chancel and one in the south wall of the nave.

    The stone reredos is unusual, constructed in 1888 and designed by F R Kempson of Hereford.

    The name of the settlement derives from the Old English for a stone or rock (stan) and a farmstead or village (tun) and long or tall (lang).

  Name: St Andrew, Stanton-upon-Hine Heath
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The original church is either late 11th Century or early 12th Century, there is Norman herring-bone masonry in one wall.  The south aisle was added to in the late 13th Century or 14th Century.  The tower is 13th Century with a late 14th Century belfry.  The porch is dated 1593.  The east end of the chancel was rebuilt in 1740 and the church was restored in 1891 - 1892.

    The church has very large stepped diagonal west buttresses, one has a datestone recording named churchwardens amongst other things.

    The chancel arch is Victorian.  The pulpit is late 17th Century.  The panelling in the chancel is probably the old box pews.  The reredos dates from 1896.

    The churchyard is circular and notably raised above the surrounding area.  This is thought to be an early Irish / Welsh tradition which influenced churches in later centuries, there are a few other examples of this in Shropshire.

    The name Stanton means stone farm or settlement in Old English (stan is a stone or rock and tun is a farmstead or settlement).  The suffix means either servant's heath or monastic community's heath.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Stapleton
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Stapleton is an ancient manor recorded in the Domesday book as Hundeslit (from the personal name Hund and the Old English for hill-side.  The present name is derived from steep-place farm/settlement (stepel and tun).

    The present church was built in the 12th Century and for reasons unknown it was originally a two storey building, a possibly unique feature amongst churches.  The second storey was built on top of the very thick walls of a Saxon or Early Norman church.  The church was on the upper floor and the ground floor is assumed to have been an undercroft (no trace now remains of the undercroft (removed in 1786)).  At one period the local population was protected from the Welsh on the ground floor. At another the congregation worshipped on the 1st floor level which has since been removed.

    The church was probably originally a dependent chapelry of Condover.

    The rectangular recess high up on the south wall is probably a medieval piscina and presumably served the upper level of the church.

    The tower was added in 1832, it is unknown when the two storey were converted into one - the result is a tall church with two tiers of windows.

    The church organ is among the top six hundred in the country and there is a small tapestry piece in the nave said to have been worked by Mary, Queen of Scots.  The altar is flanked by two tall painted German candlesticks (c. 1500).

  Name: St James, Stirchley
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: pre-1238 AD
  Description: |
    The church was first recorded in 1238 AD when it was given by Osbert, Lord of Stirchley, to Wenlock Priory.  But the church is older than this as the chancel is Norman.

    The chancel arch is the main feature of the church, and is considered one of the two finest in the county (the other being at Upton Cressett).

    The masonry of the nave and tower was encased in brick circa 1740, and the north aisle (brick) was added in 1838.

    The box pews, reading desk and pulpit are from circa 1740.  The stained glass is Victorian.  The church became redundant in 1978.

    There is a ring of three bells.  These were cast in 1410 by John de Colsale, in 1594 by Henry II Oldfield, and in 1664 by Thomas II Clibury.

    The name of the settlement literally mans 'bullock/heifer wood/clearing' from the Old English 'stirc' (a stirk, a young bullock or heifer) and leah (a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow).

  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    This church has 12th Century origins.  The lower part of the tower is Perpendicular (perhaps 14th Century) and the upper part dates from early 17th Century.  The church was heavily restored in 1858-8 at the expense of TC Whitmore of Apley Park, when th eold walls of the nave and chancel were refaced both on the inside and the outside.  Internally, the roofs are notable, there is a wagon-roof in the nave (which may include some Jacobean timbers) and a panelled oak ceiling in the chancel.

    The place name probably derives from the old English for 'farm/settlement associated with an outlying farm/settlement', as 'stoc' is the old English for a place or secondary settlement and 'tun' is the old English for a farmstead or settlement.

  Name: St Mildburh, Stoke St Milborough
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church dates back to the 13th Century, but likely has Saxon origins.  This is one of nine churches connected with Wenlock Abbey.  It is noted for its handsome ceiling and rare water leaf decoration.

    The name of the village is derived from the Old English 'stoc' meaning a place or secondary settlement and the saint to which the church is dedicated (St Milburga).  The village was known in Saxon times as Godstoke.

  Name: St Peter, Stoke on Tern
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1874-1875 AD
  Description: |
    The manor at Stoke on Tern was once very prosperous (being valued at 7 pounds at the time of the Domesday book, more than most Shropshire manors).

    The medieval church was rebuilt in the 1870s as it was in much need of restoration and repair.

    The name of the place derives from the Old English 'stoc' (meaning a place or a secondary settlement) and the nearby river Tern.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Stokesay
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1150 AD
  Description: |
    The original church was built around 1150 as a chapel to the nearby castle.  The original church was destroyed during the English Civil War; the current church is a rare example of a church extensively rebuilt during the Puritan period (1654) although some Norman features survive.

    The church is noted for the biblical texts on the walls, two decker pulpit and box and canopied pews.

    The name of Stokesay is derived from the old English 'stoc' meaning a place or secondary settlement, in this case for the de Say family, who held the manor in the 12th and 13th centuries.

  Name: St Mary, Sutton Maddock
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1579 AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday survey, the settlement was known as Sudtone (south town) as it was the southern part of the Saxon Parish of Iteshale (Shifnal).

    The "Maddock" was added in the 13th century when Sutton was granted to Iorwerth Goch (son of the ruler of Powys) in recognition of his interpreter services between England and Wales during the reign of  Henry II.  Sutton was passed to Madoc who was Iorwerth's son, but it is thought that a later member of the family also named Madoc is the one who actually gave the family name to the settlement.

    The original church may be as early as 11th Century (although it was probably a chapel annexed to Shifnal).

    The original church was replaced in the 16th Century.  In 1887, the church was rebuilt again (at a cost of 2528 pounds), the only part of the 16th Century church that was retained was the tower.

    The orgain was donated in 1889.  In 1963, the heating pipes spilt due to the heavy frost and so the coal-fired heating system was replaced by an electrical one.

    The east window was given in 1908 by Mr Charles Bruff of the Coalport China factory in memory of his mother who lived to be 102.  In 1923, the wooden reredos was presented to the church, but it obscured part of the east window. Because of this, the Bruff familiy never came to the church again, even after the reredos was altered to make the whole window visible again.

    There is a plaque in the tower to William Farmer and his wife Elizabeth, who helped Charles II during his stay at Boscobel.

    The name of village means south farm / settlement (Sutton) in Old English and Madoc is a family name.

  Name: St Peter and St Paul, Tasley
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1840-1841 AD
  Description: |
    The church was built by Josiah Griffiths of Quatford, replacing a medieval church that is said to have been timber-framed with thatch roof (in medieval times it was a chapelry of Morville).  It was built mostly at the expense of the incumbent, the Rev William Moore.  Some furnishings were salvaged from the old church and installed in the new, including the font, pulpit (Jacobean), screen fragments (late 15th or early 16th Century), Royal Arms and a wall monument.

    The church is an economical and characteristic example of the simple Gothic style favoured in Anglican churches before the ecclesiological revival of the mid-19th Century - a typical Commissioner’s Church built in the Early English style (a church built with money voted by Parliament as a result of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824).

    The principal memorial of interest is a neo-classical marble wall tablet to Rowland Hill (d 1780), by Truman of Bewdley.

    The origin of the name of settlement is unclear, leah is the Old English for a wood or clearing, but the first half is unknown, 'Teasel' has been suggested, but this has been disputed on the grounds that it does not suit the available spellings.

  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1835 AD
  Description: |
    Tilstock was a chapelry of Whitchurch until 1844.

    The present building was funded by donations from the late Earl of Bridgewater (Henry Egerton, the 8th Earl) and was designed by Edward Haycock (Haycock was a prolific architect responsible for many monuments, public buildings, country houses and churches in Shropshire).

    The brick built building is Georgian in appearance.

    The name of the settlement is derived from Tidhild's dependent settlement (stoc).

  Name: St Bartholomew, Tong
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1410 AD
  Description: |
    Sometimes referred to as the 'Westminster Abbey of the Midlands'; the church is noted for its architecture which includes a fan vaulted side chapel (which is rare in Shropshire) and its numerous tombs.

    The church was founded by the widowed Isabel Lingen as a chantry and collegiate church.  The commission to dissolve the college was issued on 17th September 1546 and referred to the legislation that permitted the king's commissioners to seize property on his behalf.

    The church is a cruciform building (rare for the Perpendicular era) and is built of red sandstone (which is abundant locally).  The church is noted for its bourdon bell which weighs over 2 tonnes and is called the Great Bell of Tong - claimed to be the loudest and biggest bell in Shropshire.  It had been feared that the tower would not support continued tolling, so it is rung only on certain days / occasions which gives the vicar of the church an equal status with the local noble families and the sitting monarch.

    The name Tong is derived from the old English 'tweonga' meaning a pinched piece or a spit of land, in this case, it describes the situation of the village between the two headstreams of the River Worfe.

  Name: St Catherine, Tugford
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is mostly Norman (the nave is older than the chancel), the tower is Early English.

    The priest's door in the south wall of the chancel has an unusual floriated tympanium which may be 11th Century and re-used from elsewhere.

    There are tomb recesses at the east end of both the north and south chancel walls.

    Just inside the south door are two small sheila-na-gigs (medieval fertility symbols).

    The front of the west gallery is panelled with tracery possibly from the former rood screen.

    The 13th Century tower originally held 3 bells dating back to 1549.

    The font is 13th Century.  The are some fragments of medieval glass in the east window.  Also, there is an original deeply-splayed Early English lancet window in the north wall of the chancel.

    The name of the settlement is from the Old English Tucga’s Ford (a personal name and a ford).

  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1856 AD
  Description: |
    The church was built by S Pountney Smith in the Early English style.  It is on the site where a medieval church once stood and is thought to incorporate some fragments of medieval masonry.

    The church is notable for the six small panels of late 17th Century glass in the windows of the south side of the nave.  On the north side are small roundels and panels of Flemish glass, probably 16th or 17th Century.

    The name of settlement means 'Uffa's farm/settlement', Uffa being a personal name, ing is connective particle and tun is an enclosure or farmstead (all Old English).

  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |

  Name: St Lucy, Upton Magna
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Magna is Latin, meaning 'great', so the translation of Upton Magna is 'Great Upton'.  Upton derives from the old English for a settlement on higher ground.

    The nave and chancel are originally Norman, as is the south doorway of the Nave.  Some original masonry survives in the chancel but the church was substantially rebuilt and enriched by the architect G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice) in the 1850s and 1860s.  The tower is Perpendicular (the final phase of Gothic architecture, which spanned the late 14th Century to the early 16th Century).

    Inside the church are several medieval wall paintings.

    One of the bells in notable as it is quite rare, it is one of only 37 (approx.)cast at a foundry in Exeter in circa 1475 to 1499.

    This church is the only one in Shropshire dedicated to St Lucy (a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution - the last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire).

  Name: St Michael, Waters Upton
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1864 AD
  Description: |
    This is one of G E Street's smaller churches in Shropshire.  It is notable because of the quality of the window tracery.  Many of the windows have 19th Century and early 20th Centiury glass which is considered to be of above avergae quality.

    Walter de Opton was the tenant in 1242, and upp is the Old English for 'up, higher up or upon' (and tun is the Old English for an enclosure or framstead).  So the name of the village derives from Walter de Opton's higher farm or settlement.

  Name: All Saints, Wellington
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1789-1790 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was built to replace a medieval one which was damaged during the Civil War.  The church was designed by George Steuart who was also responsible for St Chad's in Shrewsbury - All Saints being built a little earlier and is less impressive than St Chad's.  No extensions have been added, but the interior has been modified on a number of occasions.

    This was the first Shropshire church to introduce an entrance front in the form of a monumental classical temple portico.  The building is made of Grinshill stone with a slate roof.

    There is mention of a priest at the site in the Domesday book.  The origin of the name of the town is uncertain, but is likely to mean farm or settlement of a Saxon settler - Weola.

    The church was built in 1838 and was originally consecrated in the following year as a chapel of ease (as a daughter church to All Saints in the town centre).  The church was designed by Thomas Smith of Madeley and closely resembles his earlier church at Ironbridge.

    In the tower is the Great Bell weighing two tons which was cast for the centenary of the building in 1938.

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Welshampton
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1860s AD
  Description: |
    The present church was preceeded by a Saxon or Norman church, a medieval building dating from 1391 and church built in 1788 which became inadequate for the needs of the parish and fell into disrepair.  In 1861 a new building was commissioned from the leading architect of the day Sir George Gilbert Scott.  The walls are of yellow sandstone ashlar; the church has a slate roof which has a lozenge pattern over the nave and a zig-zag pattern over the chancel.

    Welshampton is recorded in the Domesday book as Hantone, meaning high farm or settlement.  The prefix 'Welsh' is a reflection of its proximity to Flintshire.

    An African prince is buried in the churchyard - the then vicar was as offered a post in Lesotho, which he turned down but maintained contact with the country.  The prince came to England to train as a priest and visited Welshampton when the new church was consecrated in 1863, but during the visit he caught a fever and died and so was buried at the church.

  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Norman (1095 AD or earlier)
  Description: |
    The original church was Norman and there are a few surviving elements of this church in the present building.  The advowson (the right of presentation of a candidate to a benefice or church office) of the church was presented to the Abbey of Shrewsbury as early as 1095.  Much of the church was rebuilt in 1886.

    The church has a notable tombstone (the so called Hurricane Tombstone) inside by the font under the tower, it commemorates a hurricane and snow storm which claimed the lives of seven villagers from the nearby hamlet of Asterton in 1772.

    In the Domesday book, Wentnor is listed as Wantenovre.  The name of the village means Wonta's or Wenta's (personal name) flat-topped ridge (Old English ofer).

  Name: St Mary, Westbury
  Grade: II*
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th or 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    The medieval chancel was pulled down in 1753 and rebuilt.  The tower was also rebuilt at this time as the previous tower collapsed in 1753.  The church is noted for its roof structure in the aisle and nave, said to be the oldest roof of its type in the country, dendrochronolgy dates the timbers to 1342.  It is the trussed rafters and the collar-beams on the arched braces that make this roof special.  A grant from English Heritage has paid for substantial repairs.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English west and burh meaning a fortified place, i.e. a fortified place in the west.  It was an outpost of Wroxeter Roman City, also close to Caus Castle which was a border stronghold.

  Name: St Luke, Weston-under-Redcastle
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1791 AD
  Description: |
    The church is built in the Gothic style but with a Georgian tower.  It was originally a chapel of ease, attached to the parish of Hodnet, but is now a parish church in its own right.

    The red sandstone building was constructed on the site of a medieval church which was demolished; the construction was mostly funded by Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet of Hawkstone.  It was restored in 1879, the works included the chancel, the gabled timber porch, stained glass, pews and octagonal font.

    The west window is by A L Moore (Southampton Row, London).

    Weston-under-Redcastle was called Westune in the 1086 Domesday Book, and simply refers to the settlement being to the west of the Hawkstone Ridge (red sandstone cliffs).

  Name: St Alkmund, Whitchurch
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1712 AD
  Description: |
    Whitchurch is the oldest continually inhabited town in Shropshire.

    Whitchurch acquired its present name after the construction of a Norman church in white Grinshill stone (replacing a wooden Saxon church), from the Middle English for 'White Church'.  Originally a Roman settlement it was half way between Wroxeter and Chester and so was known as Mediolanum (the place in the middle of the plain).  In the Doomsday book it was known as Westune (indicating its situation on the Western border of England).

    The Norman church was extended in medieval times, but collaspsed on Sunday 31st July 1711.

    The present church was built on the same site, this time of red sandstone.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Withington
  Grade: II
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1874 AD
  Description: |
    The church was completely rebuilt in 1874 by G E Street, the present building replacing one that had been in existence since at least medieval times.  The earlier church was built as a chapel to the nearby church at Upton Magna.

    A branch of the Shropshire Union canal ran along the south of the site, this was de-watered in the 1960's.

    The tower houses two bells from the 13th and 14th Centuries in a frame of circa 1800.  Some internal elements of the original church survive - the stone reredos depicting the crucifixion, the stone font, stone pulpit, chancel wall and the eagle lectern.

    The church is noted for its 16th Century brasses.

    The chancel has a trussed rafter roof with a collar beam added and the nave has a collar roof over.

    The place name derives from the Old English word for growing with willows / made of withies (widigen) and farm or settlement (tun).

  Name: All Saints, Worthen
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Late 12th and 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    Although not recorded in the Domesday Book, the church is of pre-Conquest origin and the large size of the parish suggests that it may have been a minster.

    The tower is unusally to the north of the nave.  The walls are 5ft thick at the base, it was likely a place of refuge in the early Middle Ages.  The lower part is Norman, the upper stages are Perpendicular and the parapet is 18th Century.  The buttresses were added probably in the 17th Century.

    The porch dates from the 17th Century.

    The chancel is Georgian (dating from 1761).

    The collection of pews is considered to be the finest assemby of ancient pews in shropshire.  The box pews are Jacobean and the plain benches are possibly medieval.  One of the box pews has a family coat of arms (Kynnaston).

    The nave is wide (33ft), it is possible ithe church had wooden arcades at some time.

    The stained glass is late 19th and 20th Century.

    The monument is to Dr. Daniel Price, rector, Dean of Hereford and Chaplain to Charles I, died 1631 but dated 1633.

    The church was restored in 1846-47.

    The nave roof is notable, it is 14th Century and of upper cruck construction in seven bays.  It was restored in 1924 when the 18th Century plaster ceil was removed.

    The name of the settlement is from the Old English wordign meaning an enclosure.

  Name: St Peter, Wrockwardine
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and so is thought to be of Saxon origin.  The current church is of Norman origin (with modifiications being made in the 14th Century).  The plan of the church forms a cruciform with the tower at the cross point, a less common layout (when compared with the more usual configuration of siting the tower at the east or west end of the building).

    The tower is Early English.  At the crossing are four multishafted piers, these are late Norman.  Much of the carving has been lost through adaptation and strengthening, but on one there is a good example of narrow fluting.  The piers support four pointed arches dating from the late 12th Century.  In the west walls of both transepts are blocked half-arches, probably put in anticipation of aisles being added to the nave.  There are walled-up doorways which are also suggestive of plans for future expansion.  At least three major restoration projects were proposed in the 19th Century but it is not clear how fully any of them was executed.

    Traces of medieval painting have survived on the apex of the east wall.

    The pulpit is Jacobean and is a particularly good example.  The communion rails are dated 1685 and are also notable for the carving - they were reinstated in 1931 having been found in Wrockwardine Hall.  The east window and the windows at the ends of the transepts are by Kempe and others are by O'Connor.  There is also a rococo monument to William Cludde (a prominent local landowner, died 1765), which may be the work of T F Pritchard. The chancel screen was installed in 1913.

    An original Norman window in the Chancel was restored in the 19th Century with stained glass depicting Holman Hunt's painting of Christ as The Light of the World.

    There are six church bells; two of them are believed to date from the 14th Century, the others mostly from the 17th Century.

    There are three fonts in the church; the weathered ancient one in the centre of the church is believed to be pre Norman. A fourth font owned by the church is currently located in the ruins of Old St Chad's Shrewsbury.

    The ancient parish chest of Wrockwardine, in the north chapel, is believed to date from the 14th Century. It is listed in an inventory of church goods, dated 1686, as 'a coffer with three locks to put the writings in that belong to the poor and charity money when it will come.'  The three locks, which all still work, require separate keys.

    The sundial in the churchyard was made in 1750 - a cast-iron base replaced a stone one in 1932.

    The name Wrockwardine is derived from the words meaning 'enclosure or settlement by the Wrekin' - Wrekin is the British name for Wroxeter (and is the name given to the nearby hill).

  Name: St Andrew, Wroxeter
  Grade: I
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    This church is likely more steeped in history than any other in Shropshire.  It is possible there was a Christian basilica on the site in late Roman Wroxeter, and it is likely there was a Saxon church after that.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was well established (four priests are mentioned).  The manor was held by Thored at the time of the Norman conquest, but was passed to Sheriff Reginald.  The church was given to Haughmond Abbey in 1155 and finally the college of priests was replaced by a vicar in 1347.

    Masonry from the Roman fort of Viroconium was plundered for the construction of the church.  The earliest part of the building (parts of the nave built of Roman masonry) dates from the 7th or 8th Centuries, and into the 8th or 9th Centuries.  The chancel was added in the late 12th Century (late Norman) as was the tower base.  The rest of the tower is late 16th Century.  Set in the upper part of the tower are pieces which may have come from Haughmond Abbey after its dissolution in 1539.  In 1763 the church was modified to remove the old south aisle and replace it with a narrower one and the vestry.

    The font is thought to be the inverted base of a Roman column.  The iron bound chest dates from the 14th Century.  The pulpit is Jacobean (17th / 18th Century).  Most of the stained glass is by David Evans of Shrewsbury (19th Century), and there is some medieval stained glass in one of the nave windows.

    The earliest tomb chest is Sir Thomas Bromley (died 1555), Chief Justice of England, and his wife.  There is also a memorial to Sir Richard Newport (died 1570) and his wife.  There is also the tomb of John Berker (died 1618j and his wife).  The other monument of note is that for Francis Newport (died 1708), first Earl of Bradford.

    The place name is a 'Roman site called Uricon'.  This was the capital of the Cornovii, called Viroconium Cornovorium by the Romans and the name probably referred originally to the hill-fort on the Wrekin and was later transferred to the Roman settlement.  The Romano-British name is perhaps, 'Urico's place', Urico is an unknown place-name and ceaster (Old English) is a city, an old fortification or a Roman site.

  Date: 1861 AD
  Description: |
    Yockleton became a parish in it's own right in the 19th Century, and those who lived in Yockleton and the surrounding areas decided to build their own Church.  The land on which the Church stands was donated by Col. Wingfield of Onslow, a local landowner.

    The Church is built of grey Alberbury stone with insets of pink Grinshill and pale Cardeston stone.
